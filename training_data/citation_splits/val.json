METHODS Sixty-nine children (39 males and 30 females) treated with LEV between 2006 and 2007 were selected. Their medical files were reviewed for LEV efficacy and tolerability. In a subgroup of children currently taking LEV, plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography by ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method and correlated with the given dose per kilo as well as clinical response.   RESULTS Fifty-one patients (74%) had a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency with 16 patients (23%) becoming seizure free on LEV. Eighteen (26%) patients had a less than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Adverse events due to LEV ranged from mild to moderate in only 18 patients (26%). The most frequently observed were drowsiness, behavioral difficulties, increase in seizure frequency and headaches. The majority (60.5%) of the responders received doses between 10 and 50mg/kg/day and had a plasma concentration (PC) between 5 and 40microg/ml. However, we found no clear correlation between PC and efficacy.   CONCLUSION Levetiracetam given twice a day in children with refractory epilepsy reduces seizure frequency in all types of epilepsy. In children, LEV is a broad spectrum anticonvulsant with a favourable safety profile.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 23}, {"paper_id": "f19f1efe04c33da82221f37a266b3a7c55c5b859", "text": "BACKGROUND While highlighting the efficacy of different treatments for major depressive disorders (MDD), findings of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP) often are interpreted as supporting the idea of treatment non-specificity for MDD. However, heterogeneity in treatment courses and outcomes might be undetected when focusing only on types of treatment in terms of sample means without taking into account early change in treatment.   METHOD In this study, growth mixture models (GMM) were used in the completer sample of N=162 patients from the NIMH TDCRP to identify meaningful patterns of early change of depression severity that are shared by many individual patients.   RESULTS Results revealed three typical patterns of early change over the first 8 weeks of treatment irrespective of the type of treatment protocol provided: (a) moderate to severe depression with moderate early improvement, (b) moderate to severe depression with rapid early improvement, and (c) mild to moderate depression with moderate early improvement. In contrast to the type of treatment, these differential patterns of early response (together with overall pre-treatment symptom severity) predicted outcomes (i.e. depression severity) at treatment termination and over the 1.5-year follow-up period.   LIMITATIONS Due to the small sample size and the controlled setting of this study the degree to which these results can be generalized to clinical practice has to be further investigated.

ADHs are major enzymes of alcohol metabolism. A polymorphism in the alcohol dehydrogenases 1C gene (ADH1C) was reportedly associated with the protective effect of alcohol consumption on CAD risk and risk factor levels.   AIMS The aim of our study was to investigate whether the association of alcohol consumption with metabolic risk factors for CAD is related to ADH1C variants.   METHODS IMMIDIET is a cross-sectional study of 974 healthy male-female pairs living together, randomly recruited in Belgium, Italy and England. The rs698 ADH1C polymorphism was genotyped. A 1-year recall food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate alcohol intake.   RESULTS The intake of alcohol did not vary in relation to ADH1C genotypes. BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, HDL or total cholesterol, triglycerides and FVII:ag levels were positively associated with alcohol intake in men (multivariate ANOVA). Regression coefficient for alcohol and BMI or WC was progressively higher in heterozygotes and gamma 2 homozygotes as compared to gamma 1 homozygotes (p=0.006 and p=0.03 for interaction, respectively). No interaction was found for other risk factors. In women, alcohol intake was positively associated with HDL, LDL and FVII:ag levels but no interaction was found between ADH1C polymorphism and any risk factor.   CONCLUSION Regulation of ADH1C genotype on the association between alcohol consumption, BMI and WC was found in men from different European countries.

The primary objective of this investigation was to determine the effect of a 14-day course of once-daily evening administration of mometasone furoate 400 \u00b5g administered via a dry powder inhaler (MF-DPI 400 \u00b5g qd pm) on the overnight decline in pulmonary function observed in patients with nocturnal asthma.  Methods: Eligible enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 60 years and had established mild to moderate asthma, with an improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of >15% after administration of inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) 200 \u00b5g. All enrolled patients had a history of nocturnal asthma. Enrollees were randomized to receive MF-DPI 400 \u00b5g qd pm or placebo administered between 6pm and 8pm for 14 days. The primary outcome evaluated in the study was reduction in nocturnal decline in evening (8pm) to morning (6am) FEV1 values. Secondary outcomes included reduction in nocturnal decline in evening to morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), polysomnographic indices of sleep, and psychometric indices (Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire [NRQLQ], 36-item Short Form of the Medical Outcomes Survey [SF-36], and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ]).  Results: A total of 20 patients were randomized and completed all phases of the study. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in the primary outcome of nocturnal decline in FEV1 from pretreatment to end of treatment. Likewise, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in polysomnographic indices of sleep or quality-of-life assessments. However, there was a trend toward improvement in the activity scale of the AQLQ assessment in the MF-DPI 400 \u00b5g qd pm treatment group.  Conclusion: No significant treatment effect on nocturnal pulmonary function, sleep indices or quality of life was observed with 14-day administration of MF-DPI 400 \u00b5g qd pm.

Methods: Behavioural survey data were collected from 3008 men in 11 cities, among whom 2158 men were tested for HIV and syphilis and 1950 for gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Risk factors for STI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Thirty-six per cent of men had sex with a female sex worker (FSW) in the previous year and 20% with non-marital female partners. Consistent condom use was low with both sex workers (17%) and other non-marital partners (13%). HIV prevalence was 2% in Papua and less than 1% elsewhere, but was for the first time detectable in a non-core transmitter male population outside of Papua. STI rates were high for a non-core transmitter group, especially syphilis. Truck drivers were the most at risk. Multivariable analyses revealed exposure to FSW and inconsistent condom use, along with geographical location (Papua vs non-Papua) and unobserved factors associated with certain occupational groups, to be key risk factors for STI infection. Conclusions: The results confirm that men in the four occupational groups are reasonable proxies for \u201chigh-risk men\u201d for surveillance purposes in Indonesia. Although HIV prevalence was low, the extent of sexual risk taking and the moderately high levels of STI among these men, along with rising HIV rates among FSW, indicate the potential for HIV/AIDS transmission in Indonesia to accelerate.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 13}, {"paper_id": "bda2fde1bf71b4458678110924bc23f8af4bdb0a", "text": "Purpose of reviewThis review describes the important role of MRI in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), exploring recent reliability and validity work, as well as the current use of MRI in clinical trials and practice.

Many of these drugs act by functionally disrupting the androgen receptor (AR), a transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation, but tumors eventually become resistant to the drugs by expressing higher levels of the AR. Tran et al. (p. 787, published online 9 April) have developed a \u201csecond-generation\u201d antiandrogen, a thiohydantoin called MDV3100, which binds the AR with high affinity. MDV3100 retains its anticancer activity in cell culture and in mouse models even when AR levels are elevated. The drug appears to act both by inhibiting translocation of the AR into the nucleus and by reducing its transcriptional activity. MDV3100 is being tested in patients with advanced prostate cancer, the first group of which have shown a decline in blood levels of a marker of cancer growth, prostate-specific antigen. A drug that binds to the androgen receptor acts by disrupting its activity in the cell nucleus. Metastatic prostate cancer is treated with drugs that antagonize androgen action, but most patients progress to a more aggressive form of the disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer, driven by elevated expression of the androgen receptor. Here we characterize the diarylthiohydantoins RD162 and MDV3100, two compounds optimized from a screen for nonsteroidal antiandrogens that retain activity in the setting of increased androgen receptor expression. Both compounds bind to the androgen receptor with greater relative affinity than the clinically used antiandrogen bicalutamide, reduce the efficiency of its nuclear translocation, and impair both DNA binding to androgen response elements and recruitment of coactivators. RD162 and MDV3100 are orally available and induce tumor regression in mouse models of castration-resistant human prostate cancer. Of the first 30 patients treated with MDV3100 in a Phase I/II clinical trial, 13 of 30 (43%) showed sustained declines (by >50%) in serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen, a biomarker of prostate cancer.

Methods and Results\u2014 Seven sixth-grade classes (182 children, aged 11.1\u00b10.7 years) were randomized to an intervention group (4 classes with 109 students) with daily school exercise lessons for 1 year and a control group (3 classes with 73 students) with regular school sports twice weekly. The significant effects of intervention estimated from ANCOVA adjusted for intraclass correlation were the following: increase of peak &OV0312;o2 (3.7 mL/kg per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 7.2) and increase of circulating progenitor cells evaluated by flow cytometry (97 cells per 1\u00d7106 leukocytes; 95% confidence interval, 13 to 181). No significant difference was seen for body mass index\u2013standard deviation score (\u22120.08; 95% confidence interval, \u22120.28 to 0.13); however, there was a trend to reduction of the prevalence of overweight and obese children in the intervention group (from 12.8% to 7.3%).

Conclusions\u2014 Regular physical activity by means of daily school exercise lessons has a significant positive effect on physical fitness (&OV0312;o2max). Furthermore, the number of circulating progenitor cells can be increased, and there is a positive trend in body mass index\u2013standard deviation score reduction and motor ability improvement. Therefore, we conclude that primary prevention by means of increasing physical activity should start in childhood. Clinical Trial Registration\u2014 URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

However, nonadherence to this recommendation is extremely high. There are no instruments available for the specific measurement of patients' perceptions of their barriers to, and attitudes toward, following a low-sodium diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a new instrument, the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ). Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the DSRQ assesses adherence through the use of 3 subscales. Each subscale represents a construct of the TPB: attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control.   METHODS The sample consisted of 174 patients with HF (age 62.4 +/- 13.5 years, 56.1% were male, 83.8% were white, and 86.9% had New York Heart Association class II/III). Factorial validity was tested using principal component analysis. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha to assess the internal consistency of the 3 subscales. Reliability was further evaluated with item-total correlations and inter-item correlations.   RESULTS Principal component analysis of the DSRQ resulted in the extraction of 3 factors, each factor corresponding to a construct of the TPB. The 3-factor solution explained a total of 54.2% of the variance, with Attitude contributing 23.4%, Perceived Behavioral Control contributing 18.1%, and Subjective Norm contributing 12.7%. The Cronbach's coefficient alpha for each subscale was Attitude .88, Subjective Norm .62, and Perceived Behavioral Control .76.

RESULTS A total of 121 EPs completed the study instrument (81%). All respondents were aware of the CMS CAP guidelines. Of these, 95% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 92% to 98%) correctly understood the time-based guidelines for antibiotic administration, although 24% (95% CI = 17% to 31%) incorrectly identified the onset of this time period. Nearly all physicians (96%; 95% CI = 93% to 99%) reported institutional commitment to meet these core measures, and 84% (95% CI = 78% to 90%) stated that they had a department-based CAP protocol. More than half of the respondents (55%; 95% CI = 47% to 70%) reported prescribing antibiotics to patients they did not believe had pneumonia in an effort to comply with the CMS guidelines, and 42% (95% CI = 34% to 50%) of these stated that they did so more than three times per month. Only 40% (95% CI = 32% to 48%) of respondents indicated a belief that the guidelines improve patient care. Of those, this was believed to occur by increasing pneumonia awareness (60%; 95% CI = 52% to 68%) and improving hospital processes when pneumonia is suspected (86%; 95% CI = 80% to 92%).   CONCLUSIONS Emergency physicians demonstrate awareness of the current CMS CAP guidelines. Most physicians surveyed reported the presence of institutional protocols to increase compliance. More than half of EPs reported that they feel the guidelines led to unnecessary antibiotic usage for patients who are not suspected to have pneumonia. Only 40% of EPs believe that CAP awareness and expedient care resulting from these guidelines has improved overall pneumonia-related patient care. Outcome-based data for non-intensive care unit CAP patients are lacking, and EPs report that they prescribe antibiotics when they may not be necessary to comply with existing guidelines.", "1_year_count": 8, "label": 33}, {"paper_id": "a749ffb31e08013862e85c894e100fb860b4b1e3", "text": "Screening can reduce incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer but has been underutilized.

Participants were Aetna members ages between 52 and 80 years from 32 primary care practices in Florida and Georgia participating in the Communicating Health Options through Information and Cancer Education study. Main outcomes were the proportion of average-risk patients who were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening based on claims data and the estimated additional yield of survey data for patients with no evidence of screening in their claims history. Of 4,020 average-risk members identified, claims data indicated that 1,066 (27%) had recent colorectal cancer screening. Among the 1,269 average-risk members with no evidence of screening by claims data who returned surveys, 498 (39%) reported being up-to-date with screening. Combining claims data and survey data and accounting for survey nonresponse, we estimate that 47% to 59% of member patients were actually up-to-date with screening, an additional yield of 20 to 32 percentage points. We conclude that, among health plan members, the combination of claims data and survey information had substantially higher yield than claims data alone for identifying colorectal cancer screening.

DESIGN Two-group experimental design.   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Pediatric outpatient clinic of a medical center in central Taiwan. Participants were 48 children, ages 6-14 years, with moderate-to-severe asthma and their parents.   METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or comparison group and matched by gender, age, and asthma severity. Both groups participated in an asthma self-management program. Children in the experimental group were also given 30 min of training in a relaxation-breathing technique and a CD for home practice. Data on anxiety levels, self-perceived health status, asthma signs/symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate, and medication use were collected at baseline and at the end of the 12-week intervention. Effects of group, time, and group-time interaction were analyzed using the Mixed Model in SPSS (12.0).   RESULTS Anxiety (especially state anxiety) was significantly lower for children in the experimental group than in the comparison group. Differences in the other four physiological variables were also noted between pre- and post-intervention, but these changes did not differ significantly between groups.

METHODS Data triangulation was undertaken in three Canadian Neonatal Intensive Care Units using data from: (a) 149 neonates at high, moderate and low risk for neurological impairment, (b) 95 nurse clinicians from the three units where infant data were collected and (c) 14 international pain researchers. Thirteen indicators were assessed following heel lance in neonates and 39 indicators generated from nurse clinicians and pain researchers were assessed for importance and accuracy. Data were collected between 2004 and 2005.   RESULTS Across risk groups, indicators with the highest accuracy for discriminating 'pain' among neonates were: brow bulge (77-83%), eye squeeze (75-84%), nasolabial furrow (79-81%), and total facial expression (78-83%).

The end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. During 1,056.4 patient-years of follow-up (median 2.02), there were 7 deaths, 3 myocardial infarctions, and 2 episodes of stent thrombosis. No significant differences in the primary end point were observed between clopidogrel users and nonusers (cumulative incidence 2.9% vs 2.8%, p = 0.578; adjusted hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 2.77).

In conclusion, this cohort of Korean patients failed to show an absolute benefit of long-term clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective collection of data on LRC in five centres.   INTERVENTION LRC.   MEASUREMENTS Preoperative morbidity was assessed clinically and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score was assigned prospectively. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index (CACI) scores were retrospectively assigned. Negative outcomes were prospectively recorded and defined as any undesired event during the perioperative period, including complications, with the latter classed according to the Clavien system. Patient, tumour, and operative variables were tested in univariate analysis as risk factors for occurrence of negative outcomes. Significant variables (p<0.05) were entered in a step-forward multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent risk factors for one or more perioperative negative outcomes. The confidence interval was settled at 95%.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS There were 148 procedures in 144 patients. Median age and tumour size were 70.5 yr (range: 32-87) and 2.6 cm (range: 1.0-5.6), respectively. A laparoscopic approach was used in 145 cases (98%). Median ASA, CCI, and CACI scores were 2 (range: 1-3), 2 (range: 0-7), and 4 (range: 0-11), respectively. Comorbidities were present in 79% of patients.

METHOD 110 inpatients with schizophrenia and a history of physical assaults were included in a randomized double-blind 12-week study. Fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were collected at baseline and at the end of the study. Ninety-three patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point after randomization to clozapine (N=34), olanzapine (N=31) or haloperidol (N=28).   RESULTS There were significant differences among the three medication groups in weight gain and in increases in blood lipids and glucose. Patients on haloperidol showed no increase on any of these parameters. Patients on olanzapine gained the most weight, but patients on clozapine had the greatest increases in cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose. An effect of ethnicity was observed, as African-American patients were more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities than other ethnic groups, especially on clozapine.   CONCLUSIONS In this prospective randomized trial, clozapine and olanzapine were associated with weight gain. Clozapine was associated with increases in both lipids and glucose. This effect was most prominent in the African-American patients.", "1_year_count": 8, "label": 57}, {"paper_id": "47c054671f0099052dde45c086aa6e3cb4de23d9", "text": "BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serial [18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose\u2013positron emission tomography ([18F] FDG-PET) in potentially operable breast cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.MethodsSerial positron emission tomography was undertaken in 66 breast cancer patients who comprised a subset of the population in a phase III randomized neoadjuvant trial at National Cancer Center, Korea.

Ten psychoeducation sessions were provided to the study group. The outcomes were measured at the baseline, immediately after (post-1), six months (post-2), and 12 months after the intervention (post-3).   RESULTS There were significant treatment effects across time for all client outcomes: adherence to medication (p<0.01), mental status (p<0.01), and insight into illness (p<0.01).

In study 2, constant-load exercise was associated with an initial moderate bronchodilatation and a late airway renarrowing. In both studies, premedication with inhaled albuterol (400 microg) promoted sustained bronchodilatation during exercise, which was additive to that caused by exercise hyperpnea.

However, this technique is limited by a lack of controlled capsule locomotion. Magnetic steering has been proposed by the main worldwide suppliers of commercial capsular endoscopes and by several research groups. The present study evaluates and discusses how robotics may improve diagnostic outcomes compared with manual magnetic steering of an endoscopic capsule.   MATERIALS AND METHODS An endoscopic capsule prototype incorporating permanent magnets was deployed in an ex vivo colon segment. An operator controlled the external driving magnet manually or with robotic assistance. The capsule was maneuvered through the colon, visualizing and contacting targets installed on the colon wall. Procedure completion time and number of targets reached were collected for each trial to quantitatively compare manual versus robotic magnetic steering ( T-test analysis with P = 0.01). Then, through a set of in vivo animal trials, the efficacy of both approaches was qualitatively assessed.   RESULTS In ex vivo conditions, robotic-assisted control was superior to manual control in terms of targets reached (87 % +/- 13 % vs 37 % +/- 14 %).

The working hypothesis was that vitamin D and calcium supplementation could prevent bone loss in ambulatory postmenopausal women.MethodsThe OSTPRE-FPS was a randomized population-based open trial with a 3-year follow-up in 3,432 women (aged 66 to 71\u00a0years). A randomly selected subsample of 593 subjects underwent BMD measurements. The supplementation group (n\u2009=\u2009287) received daily cholecalciferol 800\u00a0IU + calcium 1,000\u00a0mg for 3\u00a0years while the control group (n\u2009=\u2009306) received neither supplementation nor placebo.ResultsIn the intention-to-treat analysis, total body BMD (n\u2009=\u2009362) increased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (0.84% vs. 0.19%, p\u2009=\u20090.011). The BMD change differences at the lumbar spine (p\u2009=\u20090.372), femoral neck (p\u2009=\u20090.188), trochanter (p\u2009=\u20090.085), and total proximal femur (p\u2009=\u20090.070) were statistically nonsignificant.

The Gauging Responsiveness with A VerifyNow assay--Impact on Thrombosis And Safety (GRAVITAS) trial is designed to evaluate whether tailored clopidogrel therapy using a point-of-care platelet function assay reduces major adverse cardiovascular events after DES implantation.   STUDY DESIGN GRAVITAS is an international, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Approximately 2,800 patients with stable angina/ischemia or non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI with DES will be enrolled. Patients with high residual platelet reactivity on clopidogrel therapy 12 to 24 hours post-PCI will be randomized to standard maintenance clopidogrel therapy (75 mg daily) or high-dose clopidogrel therapy (additional loading dose followed by 150 mg daily) for 6 months. A random sample of patients without high residual reactivity will be followed and treated with standard clopidogrel therapy for 6 months.

Patients were randomized to ziprasidone (80-160 mg/day, n=73) or clozapine (250-600 mg/day, n=74). On the primary ITT-LOCF analysis, baseline-to-endpoint decreases in PANSS total scores were similar in the ziprasidone (-25.0+/-22.0, 95% CI -30.2 to -19.8) and clozapine (-24.5+/-22.5, 95% CI -29.7 to -19.2) groups. A progressive and significant reduction from baseline in PANSS total score was observed from day 11 in both study arms. There were also significant improvements on PANSS subscales, CGI-S, CG-I, CDSS, and GAF, without between-drug differences. The two treatment groups had similar rates of early discontinuations due to AEs. AEs were mostly of similar mild-moderate severity in the two groups. There were also no detrimental effects on prolactin, renal and liver function, hematology, and cardiovascular parameters. However, ziprasidone but not clozapine showed a significant reduction of SAS and AIMS scores. Moreover, when compared with clozapine, ziprasidone also had a more favorable metabolic profile, with significant endpoint differences in weight, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. In conclusion, this trial indicates that both ziprasidone and clozapine, having comparable efficacy coupled with satisfactory general safety and tolerability, may be regarded as valuable options for the short-term treatment of difficult-to-treat schizophrenia patients with a history of multiple resistance and/or intolerance to antipsychotics.

METHOD PCPs (n=61) with patients in IDEATel participated in structured interviews to determine current (2006 to 2007) and projected (2007 to 2008) use of paper and/or electronic medical data. T-tests examined group differences.   RESULTS 28% (17/61) of PCPs had comprehensive EMRs, but most electronic data were non-interoperative between offices; 6% of PCPs solely used paper; 92% of PCPs used mixed paper/electronic records. Half of 61 PCPs anticipated no migration within one year to an electronic record for common patient data, while one third anticipated that function would become greatly more electronic. Among 31 PCPs interviewed in depth in person, 70% (7/10) in private practice and 69% (9/13) in networks anticipated greater electronic media migration through system change, whereas 100% of responding academic PCPs (n=6) expected only system modifications.

A patient-held folder was provided, containing written information on cancer or treatment-related fatigue and the use of exercise to manage this, together with flyers for workshops on fatigue management held at local palliative care centres. Study evaluation questionnaires were used for patients to rate the information's usefulness and provide information regarding fatigue. Fatigue level was documented using Brief Fatigue Inventory score sheets. The main research variables were patient rating of the usefulness of the written information provided, whether patients reported being able to exercise during their cancer treatment and self-completed fatigue scores.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The assay was evaluated in 337 post-digital rectal examination urine samples (178 cancer and 159 noncancer) collected prospectively at a total of 9 clinical sites. Samples were processed wholly or after division into equal portions. Subject prostate specific antigen was 2.0 to 10.0 ng/ml. All subjects underwent transrectal ultrasound guided needle biopsy with 6 or greater cores sampled. Detection of 1 or greater markers indicated positivity.   RESULTS Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay performance was better in whole than in divided urine cohorts (p = 0.035). Assay AUC was 0.72 in the whole urine cohort and 0.67 in the combined population. These values were higher than those of prostate specific antigen alone using 4.0 ng/ml as the cutoff (p = 0.00 and 0.01, respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen patients (7 male and 8 female; mean age+/-SD, 40 years+/-6) with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Crohn's disease--Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI)>150 (n=12 patients) or <150 (n=3)--involving the terminal loop of the small bowel (wall thickness>5 mm) were included. In each patient the terminal loop was scanned by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) after sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubble injection before and after 6-month anti-inflammatory treatment. The vascularity of the terminal loop was quantified in gray-scale levels (0-255) by a manually drawn ROI encompassing the thickened bowel wall and it was correlated with CDAI.   RESULT Before the beginning of the specific treatment all patients revealed diffuse transparietal contrast enhancement after microbubble injection, except for 3 patients who revealed contrast enhancement limited to the submucosa. In 13 patients the slope of the first ascending tract and the area under the enhancement curve were significantly lower after anti-inflammatory treatment (P<0.05; Wilcoxon test) with a significant correlation with the CDAI score (rho=0.85, P<0.05). In 2 patients no significant vascularity changes were found even though a mild reduction of CDAI score was identified (from 200 to 150 gray-scale levels).

INTERVENTIONS Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic wrist strap. Control devices: a weak magnetic wrist strap, a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use.   RESULTS No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS.

The effect of therapy was adjusted for baseline blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphate product, alkaline phosphatase, PTH and GFR using ANOVA. The primary end point was the decrease in serum phosphorus levels after 12\u00a0weeks of treatment.ResultsOf the 22 patients enrolled, data of 19 patients were used for analysis. The adjusted mean serum phosphate levels at 12\u00a0weeks did not differ significantly between calcium acetate- (5.3\u00a0mg/dl) and sevelamer-treated subjects (6.1\u00a0mg/dl) (P adjusted means\u00a0=\u00a00.6). The adjusted blood level of calcium at 12\u00a0weeks was significantly lower in the sevelamer-treated patients (8.2\u00a0mg/dl) compared to those treated with calcium acetate (9.1\u00a0mg/dl) (P adjusted means\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In the sevelamer group, there was a non-significant decrease in serum bicarbonate, whereas the total and LDL cholesterol significantly decreased at 12\u00a0weeks (P = 0.04).

However, these were inconsistent, and few examined whether race and gender influenced the relationship. This study determined a cross-sectional association between physical activity and hs-CRP level in 6142 middle-aged white, Chinese, black, and Hispanic participants enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in 2000-2002.   METHODS Combined moderate and vigorous physical activity was measured by self-reported leisure, conditioning, occupational, and household activities. ANCOVA was used to assess the association between moderate/vigorous physical activity and hs-CRP by gender and race.   RESULTS Hs-CRP was higher in women. Blacks had the highest hs-CRP, and Chinese participants had the lowest. Hs-CRP decreased across tertiles of moderate/vigorous physical activity in Hispanic men in models adjusted for age, education, study site, and physical activity questionnaire mode of administration (p=0.005) and further adjusted for smoking, infection, and aspirin use (p=0.020). The trend remained significant after further adjustment for BMI; blood pressure; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; diabetes; and the use of antihypertensive, statin, and diabetes medication (p=0.044). There was a downward trend in hs-CRP across tertiles of physical activity in black and white men, but the association was weaker. No clear trend was observed in any female racial/ethnic groups.

India, a major illicit opiate consumer, is also the sole licensed exporter of raw opium: this unique status may be enabling substantial diversion to the illicit market.   METHODS Participant observation and interviews were carried out at eight different sites. Information was also drawn from all standard secondary sources and the analysis of about 180 drug-related criminal proceedings reviewed by Indian High Courts and the Supreme Court from 1985 to 2001.   FINDINGS Diversion from licit opium production takes place on such a large scale that India may be the third largest illicit opium producer after Afghanistan and Burma. With the possible exceptions of 2005 and 2006, 200-300 tons of India's opium may be diverted yearly. After estimating India's opiate consumption on the basis of UN-reported prevalence estimates, we find that diversion from licit production might have satisfied a quarter to more than a third of India's illicit opiate demand to 2004.   CONCLUSIONS India is not only among the world's largest consumer of illicit opiates but also one of the largest illicit opium producers. In contrast to all other illicit producers, India owes the latter distinction not to blatantly illicit cultivation but to diversion from licit cultivation.

Methods From 1998\u20142003, BIG 1-98 enrolled 8028 women to receive monotherapy with either tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years, or sequential therapy of 2 years of one agent followed by 3 years of the other.

Statistical power was increased by an enriched design, which included patients who were assigned sequential treatments until the time of the treatment switch.

Methods:Logistic regression was used to characterize patients with delayed first consultation among 3151 HIV-infected adults. Results:Fifteen percent of patients reported a delay of at least 6 months before their first consultation after HIV diagnosis. In the multivariate analysis adjusted for the frequency of visits to the HIV center, independent correlates of reporting a delay of at least 6 months before consulting included the characteristics of the HIV centers (created before 2005 and located in small or medium-size hospitals) and the following individual patient characteristics: sex and matrimonial status (women living in a couple), the circumstances of the HIV diagnosis (test not performed in the hospital providing HIV care, test performed during a voluntary screening campaign) and patient's negative perception of antiretroviral treatment toxicity.

Finding no differences, and in view of the persistent anti-beta cell autoimmunity in such patients, we speculated that the immunosuppression (to weaken autoimmune attack) and euglycaemia accompanying transplant-based treatments of type 1 diabetes might promote recovery of native pancreatic beta cell function.MethodsWe performed arginine stimulation tests in three islet transplant and four whole-pancreas transplant recipients, and measured stimulated C-peptide in select venous sampling sites.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood pressure and ocular parameters, including intraocular pressure and prevalence of major ophthalmic diseases.   RESULTS Mean age of participants in the present study was 60.4+/-10.0 years. Hypertension was present in 1500 (46.6%) of the 3222 subjects who had their blood pressure measured. In multiple regression analysis, hypertension was associated with higher intraocular pressure (beta = 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.66; P = 0.005), focal arteriolar narrowing (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34-2.36; P<0.001), arteriovenous nicking (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.11-2.04; P = 0.009), generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.30-2.09; P<0.001), retinal vein occlusions (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.21-6.80; P = 0.02), and diabetic retinopathy (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.08-3.31; P = 0.02). Hypertension was not significantly associated with the prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (P = 0.19), angle-closure glaucoma (P = 0.15), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (P = 0.73), nuclear cataract (P = 0.88), posterior subcapsular cataract (P = 0.30), cortical cataract (P = 0.10), or area of alpha zone (P = 0.05) or beta zone of parapapillary atrophy (P = 0.95).   CONCLUSIONS In Chinese persons, while controlling for other systemic parameters, hypertension was associated with increased intraocular pressure, retinal microvascular abnormalities, and prevalence of retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy.

Subjects with a low level of self-efficacy at baseline and high level of worry immediately after GC seemed to be vulnerable to both intrusion and avoidance. Lower level of intrusion was also associated with having a first-degree relative with cancer, while a lower avoidance level was associated with a higher level of education, having cancer, more social support, and higher satisfaction with GC.ConclusionsIn this study, subjects who had lower level of self-efficacy at baseline and a high level of worry immediately after GC seemed to be vulnerable to both intrusion and avoidance in this study.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 14}, {"paper_id": "1dd82230d76f4dd5511dbb3f5597cabec3be81ba", "text": "Objectives: To provide nationally representative data on trends in HIV testing in primary care and to estimate the proportion of diagnosed HIV positive individuals known to general practitioners (GPs). Methods: We undertook a retrospective cohort study between 1995 and 2005 of all general practices contributing data to the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD), and data on persons accessing HIV care (Survey of Prevalent HIV Infections Diagnosed). We identified all practice-registered patients where an HIV test or HIV positive status is recorded in their general practice records. HIV testing in primary care and prevalence of recorded HIV positive status in primary care were estimated. Results: Despite 11-fold increases in male testing and 19-fold increases in non-pregnant female testing between 1995 and 2005, HIV testing rates remained low in 2005 at 71.3 and 61.2 tests per 100 000 person years for males and females, respectively, peaking at 162.5 and 173.8 per 100 000 person years at 25\u201334 years of age.

BACKGROUND Previous Phase-1 trials showed feasibility of epicardial injection of myoblasts. However, catheter-based delivery has several advantages: it can be applied on high-risk patients, the procedure can be repeated, and it is associated with less morbidity and mortality.   METHODS Twenty-three subjects, with previous myocardial infarction and heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV, were enrolled, 11 control and 12 treatment subjects. To assess safety, physical exam, electrocardiogram, continuous rhythm monitoring, quality of life assessments, and heart function were evaluated at baseline and follow-up until 1 year.   RESULTS There was favorable safety: no difference between groups in arrhythmias, and no deaths. Treated subjects showed sustained improvements in NYHA and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) compared with control subjects (NYHA, -1.0 point in treatment vs. +0.3 point in control group, p < 0.0004; MLHFQ, -14 point in treatment vs. +1 point in the control group, p = 0.004).

Finally, NOGA voltage mapping demonstrated improved voltage measurements (+1.0 mV, p = 0.008).   CONCLUSIONS This trial of myoblast transplantation via catheter into heart failure patients demonstrated safety and feasibility.

Blood pressure (BP) and urinary electrolytes were measured every 3 weeks. After 12 weeks, collagen deposition in the heart and kidney and the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and nitric oxide (NO) in plasma and renal cortex were measured.

We hypothesized that low numeracy participants would better understand risks presented using grouped dot displays, while high numeracy participants would have good understanding, regardless of display type. Moreover, we predicted that dispersed dot displays, in contrast to grouped dot displays, would increase risk perceptions and worry only for highly numerate individuals.

Recreational soccer can improve the reflex response to sudden trunk loading among untrained women. J Strength Cond Res 23(9): 2621-2626, 2009-A slower reflex response to sudden trunk loading (SL) has been shown to increase future risk of low back injuries in healthy subjects, and specific readiness training can improve the response to SL among healthy subjects. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of recreational soccer training on the reaction to SL among untrained healthy women. Thirty-six healthy, untrained, Danish women (age 19-45 years) were randomly assigned to a soccer group (SO, n = 19) and a running group (RU, n = 17). In addition, an untrained control group (CON, n = 10) was recruited. Training was performed for 1 hour twice a week (mean heart rate of 165 b\u00b7min\u22121 in SO and 164 b\u00b7min\u22121 in RU) for 16 weeks. Test of reactions to sudden unexpected trunk loading was performed before and after the training period. Furthermore, time-motion analysis of the soccer training was performed for 9 subjects. Group assignment was blinded to the test personnel. Physical education students organized the training. During 1 hour of soccer training, the total number of sudden moves including sudden loading of the upper body (e.g. turns, stops, throw-ins, headers, and shoulder tackles) was 192 (63). In SO, time elapsed until stopping of the forward movement of the trunk (stopping time) decreased (p < 0.05) by 15% and distance moved after unexpected SL decreased (p < 0.05) by 24% compared with no changes in RU and CON.

Our objective was to compare the effects of AIR inhaled insulin (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN) (AIR is a registered trademark of Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, MA) with those of injectable insulin on glycemic control and safety.   METHODS This was planned as a 24-month, open-label, randomized study in adults with diabetes inadequately controlled by one or more oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs). Following a 2-week baseline period, patients continued OAMs and were randomized to AIR insulin (n = 208) or insulin lispro (n = 203) before meals. The primary end point was hemoglobin A1C (A1C) change from baseline to 6 months. Noninferiority was established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in A1C change was < or =0.4%.   RESULTS Early termination of the study diminished the number of patients for the 12- and 24-month analyses, but not for the primary 6-month end point analyses. AIR insulin and injectable insulin groups had comparable baseline A1C values (8.18% vs. 8.21%, respectively). Change in A1C from baseline to 6-month end point was similar (least squares mean, -0.81 +/- 0.09% and -0.87 +/- 0.09%; 95% confidence interval for the difference -0.117, 0.234; P = 0.51) and so were final A1C values of 7.36% and 7.31% for AIR insulin and injectable insulin, respectively. At 6 months, no differences were observed in eight-point profiles, overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia, and weight gain. Greater decreases in spirometry were observed in the AIR insulin group at 12 months. Cough was the most frequently reported adverse event (20% [AIR insulin] vs. 10% [insulin lispro]; P = 0.002).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of alendronate and indapamide alone or in combination on bone mineral density (BMD) and 24-h urinary calcium excretion (24-CaU) in post-menopausal women with HC and low BMD.   METHODS A total of 77 post-menopausal women with HC (24-CaU > 4 mg/kg/day) and low BMD [T-score < -2.0 at lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN) or total hip (TH)] from two centres of Northern Italy were randomized to receive indapamide 2.5 mg daily alone (24 patients, IND group), alendronate 70 mg weekly alone (27 patients, ALN group) or the combination therapy (26 patients, ALN + IND group). Throughout the study, all subjects received daily calcium supplements, depending on their dietary intake, to maintain a daily input of 1000 mg. Patients were instructed to increase water intake up to 2000 mL daily. The percentage and absolute changes of BMD at LS, FN and TH, and the variation of 24-CaU from baseline at 1 year were the primary outcomes. Serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone and bone alkaline phosphatase were also measured.   RESULTS Overall 67 women completed the study and were included in the final analysis. Patients in the three groups were similar with regard to baseline characteristics. BMD did not significantly change from baseline after 1 year of treatment with indapamide (LS: +1 +/- 3.1%; FN: -0.3 +/- 3.5%; TH: -0.4 +/- 3.1%), while it showed a significant increase from baseline in the other two groups (ALN; LS: +5.8 +/- 4.2%, P < 0.001; FN: +3.9 +/- 7.9%, P = 0.018; TH: +2 +/- 3.6%, P = 0.006) (ALN + IND; LS: +8.2 +/- 5.3%, P < 0.001; FN: +4.9 +/- 6.7%, P = 0.007; TH: +2.9 +/- 4.2%, P = 0.004). Patients in the combination group showed a significantly higher increase of BMD at LS compared to ALN (P = 0.04). After 1 year, 24-CaU values significantly decreased from baseline in all groups (IND, 239 +/- 78 versus 364 +/- 44, P < 0.001) (ALN, 279 +/- 68 versus 379 +/- 79, P < 0.001) (ALN + IND, 191 +/- 68 versus 390 +/- 55, P < 0.001). The mean percentage decrease of 24-CaU in ALN + IND group (-50%) was significantly greater compared to ALN (-24%, P < 0.001) and IND (-35%, P = 0.012).   CONCLUSIONS These results show a benefit, in terms of BMD improvement and 24-CaU reduction, associated with BPs' therapy in combination with indapamide in HC associated with osteoporosis. The combination therapy demonstrated a reduction of 24-CaU and an increase in LS BMD superior to that observed with alendronate alone.

We examined the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin before and after the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir.   METHODS We analyzed 10 patients with HIV infection and active tuberculosis in a state tuberculosis hospital. Plasma was collected for measurement of rifabutin, the microbiologically active 25-desacetyl-rifabutin, and lopinavir by validated high-performance liquid chromatography assays. Samples were collected 2-4 weeks after starting rifabutin at 300 mg thrice weekly without lopinavir-ritonavir, 2 weeks after the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir at 400 and 100 mg, respectively, twice daily to rifabutin at 150 mg thrice weekly, and (if rifabutin plasma concentrations were below the normal range) 2 weeks after an increase in rifabutin to 300 mg thrice weekly with lopinavir-ritonavir. Noncompartmental and population pharmacokinetic analyses (2-compartment open model) were performed.   RESULTS Rifabutin at 300 mg without lopinavir-ritonavir produced a low maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) in 5 of 10 patients. After the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir to rifabutin at 150 mg, 9 of 10 had low C(max) values. Eight patients had dose increases to 300 mg of rifabutin with lopinavir-ritonavir. Most free rifabutin (unbound to plasma protein) C(max) values were below the tuberculosis minimal inhibitory concentration. For most patients, values for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve were as low or lower than those associated with treatment failure or relapse and with acquired rifamycin resistance in Tuberculosis Trials Consortium/US Public Health Service Study 23.

Effective interventions for the negative effects of unloading are critical but not yet available.   PURPOSE To test the hypothesis that high-frequency, low-magnitude mechanical signals (LMMS) can attenuate the detrimental morphologic changes in the lumbar IVDs.   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Volunteers were subjected to 90d of BR and 7d of reambulation. While retaining this supine position, 18 random subjects received LMMS (30Hz) for 10min/d, at peak-to-peak acceleration magnitudes of either 0.3g (n=12) or 0.5g (n=6). The remaining subjects served as controls (CTRs).   PATIENT SAMPLE Eighteen males and 11 female (33+/-7y) healthy subjects of astronaut age (35+/-7y, 18 males, 11 females) and without a history of back pain participated in this study.   OUTCOME MEASURES A combination of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans of the lumbar spine of all subjects were taken at baseline, 60d, 90d, and 7d post-BR. Back pain was self-reported.   METHODS IVD morphology, spine length, and back pain were compared between CTR and LMMS subjects.   RESULTS Compared with untreated CTRs, LMMS attenuated mean IVD swelling by 41% (p<.05) at 60d and 30% (p<.05) at 90d. After 7 days of reambulation, disc volume of the CTR group was still 8% (p<.01) greater than at baseline, whereas that for the LMMS group returned the disc volume to baseline levels. In contrast to BR alone, LMMS also retained disc convexity at all time points and reduced the incidence of LBP by 46% (p<.05).

RESULTS In the placebo group, four patients dropped out because of recurrence of craniopharyngioma, manifestation of type 1 diabetes, and change of residence (n = 2); in the DHEA group, one patient dropped out because of recurrent anxiety attacks. DHEA substitution resulted in normalization of DHEA sulfate and androstanediol glucuronide morning serum levels 2 h after drug intake (P < 0.006), and of its 24 h urinary metabolite levels (P < 0.0001), placebo had no effect. Morning serum levels of androstenedione increased in the DHEA group (P < 0.02) but did not normalize. The DHEA group exhibited significant progress in pubic hair growth from Tanner stage I-III to II-V (mean: +1.5 stages), whereas the placebo group did not (relative risk 0.138; 95% confidence interval 0.021-0.914; P = 0.0046). Importantly, eight of the 10 Symptom Check-List-90-R scores, including those for depression, anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity, and the global severity index improved in the DHEA group in comparison to the placebo group (P < 0.048). DHEA was well tolerated.

Mortality rates were calculated for both children on treatment and children not started on ART.ResultsOver half (53%) of children were 5 years or above and only 69(6%) were <18 months. Overall, 9% (105/1168) of children died since the set-up of the programs. By the end of the observation period, 66(14.5%) patients not on ART had died compared to 39(5.5%) of those under treatment, and 100(22%) who did not start ART were lost-to-follow-up compared to13(2%) on ART. 66/105 (62.8%) of all in-program deaths occurred before starting ART, of which 56% (37/66) and 79% (52/66) occurred within 3 and 6 months of enrolment respectively.

There is currently no consensus definition for renal failure, however, the American College of Surgeons' Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) defines ARF as a serum creatinine > or =3.5, blood urea nitrogen > 100, or renal replacement therapy. We hypothesize that by using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) staging system we would identify smaller changes in renal function that may impact outcome, and may serve as a marker for mortality and other organ dysfunction.   METHODS We retrospectively identified all trauma patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for >48 hours during a 3-year period ending December 2007. Hourly urine output, serum creatinine, demographic data, trauma scores, admission vital signs, ICU and hospital length of stay, need for renal replacement therapy, organ failure, and death were collected and were stratified according to AKIN and ACSCOT renal dysfunction criteria. Trauma patients admitted to the SICU who did not develop renal dysfunction were used as controls.   RESULTS A total of 571 patients were studied. Of those, only 17 patients (3.0%) were classified as having ARF by the ACSCOT criteria, whereas 170 (29.8%) had kidney injury using the AKIN criteria (146, stage 1; 15, stage 2; 9, stage 3). Compared with patients admitted to the ICU for > or =48 hours with normal renal function, patients meeting AKIN criteria had longer hospital and ICU length of stay (p < 0.001). Patients meeting AKIN criteria also had an increased incidence of multiple organ failure and death (p < 0.03).   CONCLUSIONS Stratification using the AKIN criteria for acute kidney injury identifies an increased number of patients with renal dysfunction compared with the current ACSCOT criteria.

This paper makes a case for using constraint-based data structure repair, a recently developed technique for fault recovery, as a basis for automated debugging. Data structure repair uses given structural integrity constraints for key data structures to monitor their correctness during the execution of a program. If a constraint violation is detected, repair performs mutations on the data structures, i.e., corrupt program state, and transforms it into another state, which satisfies the desired constraints. The primary goal of data structure repair is to transform an erroneous state into an acceptable state. Therefore, the mutations performed by repair actions provide a basis of debugging faults in code (assuming the errors are due to bugs). A key challenge to embodying this insight into a mechanical technique arises due to the difference in the concrete level of the program states and the abstract level of the program code: repair actions apply to concrete data structures that exist at runtime, whereas debugging applies to code. We observe that static structures (program variables) hold handles to dynamic structures (heap-allocated data), which allows bridging the gap between the abstract and concrete levels. We envision a tool-chain where a data structure repair tool generates repair logs that are used by a fault localization tool and a repair abstraction tool that apply in synergy to not only identify the location of fault(s) in code but also to synthesize debugging suggestions.

We investigated how some of these technical modalities affected the results of platelet aggregation obtained after clopidogrel administration.   MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and twenty stable coronary artery disease patients requiring a diagnostic angiography were recruited prior to pre-treatment with clopidogrel. Blood samples were tested before clopidogrel initiation and immediately preceding coronary angiography using light transmission aggregometry with either 5 or 20 microM of ADP. Aggregation was measured at maximal amplitude (peak), and 5 minutes after agonist addition (late).   RESULTS While measurements of platelet aggregation as either peak or late aggregation were strongly correlated, peak platelet aggregation was significantly higher than late aggregation, by 10.8% and by 10.3% with ADP 5 and 20 microM, respectively. Moreover, the use of ADP 20 microM resulted in less spontaneous disaggregation than 5 microM in the absence of clopidogrel (11.8% and 4.8% with ADP 5 microM and 20 microM, respectively).

METHODS From the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) database of patients receiving RRT between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2004, we identified two cohorts: 2033 patients who had been on either haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for at least a year and who subsequently underwent transplantation and then survived at least a year (PD + HD to Tp); and 892 patients who had been on PD for at least a year who changed to HD and then survived at least a year (PD to HD).

RESULTS In the PD + HD to Tp cohort, transplantation was associated with a rise in haemoglobin, albumin and bicarbonate, a fall in ferritin and phosphate, no change in calcium, a fall (but not to normal) in PTH and a transient rise in cholesterol concentrations. In the PD to HD group, the change in modality was associated with a significant temporary fall in haemoglobin, a progressive rise in ferritin, albumin, phosphate and PTH, no change in calcium and fall in bicarbonate and cholesterol concentrations.

However, isolation is often impermanent, and return of conduction (RoC) is associated with recrudescent AF.

Our objective was to perform an anatomical analysis as a means to gain further insight into RoC risk factors and mechanism(s) after wide-area circumferential ablation.MethodsRetrospective review of data from 512 consecutive patients who underwent wide-area circumferential antral ablation. After achieving left and right antral electrical isolation, each patient underwent a period of observation for RoC during this initial procedure. In addition, 76 of the 512 patients underwent a repeat procedure at an average of 10\u00a0months later, at which time they were again assayed for RoC.ResultsLeft or right antral RoC was observed in 39 (8%) or 21 (4%) patients, respectively, during the initial procedure, and 26 (34%) or 16 (21%) patients, respectively, during the repeat procedure. Left antral RoC was more commonly observed among patients manifesting a long segment separating the circumferential lesion and the venoatrial junctions, and usually occurred in this segment, often at sites distant from ablated sites. Right antral RoC commonly occurred in the anterior and superior antral regions, also often at sites that were distant from ablated sites.ConclusionsIn the left antrum, there was a correlation between electrophysiologic (RoC) and anatomic (long segment) properties. The observation in both antra that RoC often occurred in previously unablated areas suggested that, as an alternative to recovery of ablated myocardium, a second mechanism of RoC was plausible: conduction via unablated myocardium, which was not immediately manifest.

Delay discounting, or a preference for smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards, is considered an important aspect of impulsivity, and delay-related impulsivity has been emphasized in etiological models of ADHD. In this study, we examined whether stimulant medication, an effective treatment for ADHD, reduced discounting of delayed experiential and hypothetical rewards among 49 children (ages 9-12 years) with ADHD. After a practice day, participants completed a 3-day double-blind placebo-controlled acute medication assessment. Active doses were long-acting methylphenidate (Concerta), with the nearest equivalents of 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg TID immediate-release methylphenidate. On each testing day, participants completed experiential (real-world money in real time) and hypothetical discounting tasks. Relative to placebo, methylphenidate reduced discounting of delayed experiential rewards but not hypothetical rewards. Broadly consistent with etiological models that emphasize delay-related impulsivity among children with ADHD, these findings provide initial evidence that stimulant medication reduces delay discounting among those with the disorder. The results also draw attention to task parameters that may influence the sensitivity of various delay discounting measures to medication effects.", "1_year_count": 5, "label": 105}, {"paper_id": "94fd789a76ff2b9ce994eb42935a3d98adc144eb", "text": "BACKGROUND More than half of patients with depression go undetected. Self-rating scales can be useful in screening for depression, and measuring severity and treatment outcome.   AIM This study compares the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) with regard to their psychometric properties, and investigates their agreement at different cut-off scores.   METHOD Swedish primary care patients and psychiatric outpatients (n = 737) who reported symptoms of depression completed the self-rating scales. Data were collected from 2006 to 2007. Analyses with respect to internal consistency, factor analysis, and agreement (Cohen's kappa) at recommended cut-offs were performed.   RESULTS Both scales had high internal consistency (alpha = 0.9) and stable factor structures. Using severity cut-offs, the PHQ-9 (> or =5) diagnosed about 30% more patients than the HADS depression subscale (HADS-D; > or =8). They recognised the same prevalence of mild and moderate depression, but differed in relation to severe depression. When comparing recommended screening cut-offs, HADS-D > or =11 (33.5% of participants) and PHQ-9 > or =10 (65.9%) agreement was low (kappa = 0.35). Using the lower recommended cut-off in the HADS-D (> or =8), agreement with PHQ-9 > or =10 was moderate (kappa = 0.52). The highest agreement (kappa = 0.56) was found comparing HADS-D > or =8 with PHQ-9 > or =12. This also equalised the prevalence of depression found by the scales.   CONCLUSION The HADS and PHQ-9 are both quick and reliable. The HADS has the advantage of evaluating both depression and anxiety, and the PHQ-9 of being strictly based upon the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The agreement between the scales at the best suitable cut-off is moderate, although the identified prevalence was similar. This indicates that the scales do not fully identify the same cases.

METHODS AND RESULTS We conducted a prospective, randomized, single blind, crossover design study (the post-long pause overdrive pacing study) to test the efficacy of an improved version of PMOP (PMOP(enhanced)). A total of 45 patients were enrolled, of whom 41 were analysed. The median number of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF) episodes per day (1.38 vs. 1.19), the median number of early recurrences of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) per day (0.56 vs. 0.51), and the median AT/AF burden (time per day spent in AT/AF) (2.47 vs. 2.51 h) were not significantly different during the control and active study periods. Based on the median number of episodes per week recorded 90 days prior to enrollment, the patients were stratified by the median and then split into two groups, Group A (lower 2-Quartiles) and Group B (upper 2-Quartiles). The median AT/AF burden was significantly lower in Group B during the active study period (3.71 vs. 1.71 h, P = 0.02).The median number of AT/AF episodes per day and the median number of ERAF per day in Group B showed a trend towards reduction when the algorithm was turned on (3.79 vs. 2.44 and 2.77 vs. 1.86, respectively).

METHODS We examined management of post-CABG AF in the PREVENT-IV trial, and we explored patterns of use of postoperative rhythm versus rate control and anticoagulation for AF by geographic region and type of site. We also compared outcomes of patients who developed post-CABG AF (663) with those who did not (2,131).   RESULTS The incidence of AF was 24%. Post-CABG AF was treated with a rhythm control strategy in 81% of patients and with warfarin in 23% of patients. Although there were significant variations across sites in the management of post-CABG AF, patterns of use of postoperative rhythm versus rate control and anticoagulation did not differ by geographic region or by whether or not the enrolling site was an academic institution. Mortality was higher in patients with post-CABG AF than patients without AF at 30 days (1.5% vs 0.7%, P = .01) but not at 3 years (6.9% vs 4.9%, P = .41).

METHODS Eligible eyes were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups: the IVB group received 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab 1 week before surgery, and the control group underwent a sham procedure.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the incidence of early postvitrectomy hemorrhage. Secondary outcome measures included changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and IVB-related adverse events.   RESULTS Of 68 eyes, 35 and 33 eyes were in the IVB and control groups, respectively. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of postvitrectomy hemorrhage 1 week and 1 month after surgery was significantly lower in the IVB group compared with the control group (P = 0.023 and P = 0.001, respectively).

METHODS This was a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group noninferiority study. Adults with 3 to 12 migraines per month were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive an initial dose of 25 mg/d of either topiramate or amitriptyline, subsequently titrated to a maximum of 100 mg/d (or the maximum tolerated dose). The primary efficacy outcome was the change from prospective baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine episodes. Secondary efficacy variables included changes from the prospective baseline phase to the end of the double-blind phase in the mean monthly (28-day) rate of days with migraine, mean monthly rate of days with headache (migraine and nonmigraine), mean monthly rate of acute abortive medication use, mean monthly migraine duration, and mean monthly migraine severity. Additional secondary efficacy variables included changes in the mean monthly severity of migraine-associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), change in the mean monthly frequency f migraine-associated vomiting, and response rates (based on monthly migraine days and total headache days). The Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Weight Satisfaction Scale Questionnaire, which measures subjective satisfaction with current weight, were administered. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored through the end of double-blind treatment.   RESULTS The intent-to-treat population included 331 subjects (172 topiramate, 159 amitriptyline; 84.9% female; 84.6% white; mean [SD] age, 38.8 [11.0] years; mean weight, 77.1 [20.1] kg) who provided at least 1 efficacy assessment. The least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine episodes was not significantly different between the topiramate and amitriptyline groups (-2.6 and -2.7, respectively; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.7). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in any of the prespecified secondary outcome measures. Subjects receiving topiramate had a significantly greater improvement in mean functional disability scores during migraine attacks compared with amitriptyline (LSM change: -0.33 vs -0.19; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.0; P = 0.040) and in the role function-restrictive, role function-preventive, and emotional function domains of the MSQ (P = 0.012, P = 0.014, and P = 0.029, respectively). Subjects receiving topiramate had a mean weight loss of 2.4 kg, compared with a mean weight gain of 2.4 kg in subjects receiving amitriptyline. Subjects in the topiramate group reported an overall improvement from baseline in weight satisfaction, whereas the amitriptyline group reported an overall deterioration in weight satisfaction (P < 0.001, topiramate vs amitriptyline). TEAEs of mild or moderate severity were reported in 118 subjects (66.7%) in the topiramate group and 112 subjects (66.3%) in the amitriptyline group. Among the most common TEAEs (reported in +/-5% of subjects during the double-blind phase) in the topiramate group were paresthesia (29.9%), fatigue (16.9%), somnolence (11.9%), hypoesthesia (10.7%), and nausea (10.2%).

Laboratory values including glycosylated hemoglobin A (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and C-peptide were followed throughout the 12\u00a0months. Serum levels of gastric inhibitory peptide and ghrelin were followed for 1\u00a0month. Serum levels of gastrin and glucagon-like peptide were followed for 3\u00a0months.ResultsAt 12\u00a0months after surgery, all subjects consistently felt relief from fatigue, pain and/or numbness in the extremities, polyuria, and polydypsia. Clinical resolution was obtained for one patient, and the preoperative diabetic medication requirements decreased for most of the other patients. The subjects demonstrated an overall improved HbA1c (from 9.4% to 8.5%) and fasting blood glucose level (from 209 to 154\u00a0mg/dl). Although the change in fasting blood glucose approached statistical significance, these measures of glucose homeostasis did not achieve significance. Cholesterol and triglycerides increased slightly, and C-peptide decreased slightly over 1\u00a0year. These changes were not statistically significant.ConclusionsAlthough this is a small series, our data show that at 12\u00a0months after surgery, clinical improvement was obvious in all of our seven patients, but LDJB may not be effective at inducing remission of T2DM and the MS in certain patients undergoing this operation. This suggests that larger patient studies should be conducted, before concluding that surgery may offer clinical and biochemical resolution to a disease once treated only medically.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Following clinical and PSG screening, 75 patients (mean age: 45.1+/-11.2 y; 50 f, 25 m) meeting DSM-IV criteria for primary insomnia entered this crossover study and were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment sequences of 1.5 mg or 2.5 mg EVT 201, or placebo using a balanced Latin square design. For each study condition study medication was administered on two consecutive nights and PSG and self-reported data were collected. Safety assessments included physical examination, clinical laboratory measures, electrocardiogram, documentation of adverse events, and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and self-reported sleepiness/alertness ratings to detect residual sedation. Data were collected at five US sleep laboratories. Efficacy analyses were performed for the 67 patients completing the study. Safety analyses included all 75 randomized patients.   RESULTS On PSG measures compared to placebo, EVT 201 1.5 mg and 2.5 mg increased total sleep time (TST; 33.1, 45.0 min; both p<0.0001), reduced wake after sleep onset (WASO; -16.7, -25.7 min; both p<0.0001), reduced latency to persistent sleep (LPS; -17.0, -20.7 min; both p<0.0001), and reduced the number of awakenings (-1.2, -2.6; both p<0.0001). Significant reduction of wake time was seen with 1.5 mg during each of the first three quarters of the night (p<0.0001-0.002), and with 2.5 mg in all four quarters (p<0.0001-0.0005). Both doses also improved all key self-reported measures of sleep including total sleep time (rTST; 51.9, 51.1 min; both p<0.0001), wake after sleep onset (rWASO; -29.3, -29.6 min; both p<0.0001), sleep latency (rSL; -24.0 min, p<0.004; -25.1 min, p<0.0002), and number of awakenings (rNAW; -1.1, -1.2; both p<0.0001). Sleep quality was also improved by both doses. Self-rated sleepiness in the morning did not differ from placebo for either dose; however, there was a small negative effect on the DSST for both doses. Both doses had similar effects on sleep architecture including an increase in Stage 2 sleep and REM latency and a small, but significant decrease in REM (REM -5.7, -8.3 min; p=0.0175, p=0.0006). No effect on other sleep architecture parameters, including SWS, was seen. EVT 201 was well tolerated. No serious or unexpected adverse events were reported.

This condition results in an increased risk for thrombotic complications such as stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The aim of the study was to determine clinical parameters modulating ASA and clopidogrel responsiveness. Patients were enrolled into three groups: (A) Patients with coronary artery disease without recent PCI treated with 100\u00a0mg/day ASA (n\u00a0=\u00a067). (B) Patients who underwent coronary stent implantation taking 100\u00a0mg/day ASA and 75\u00a0mg/day clopidogrel (n\u00a0=\u00a087). (C) Patients in whom CAD was excluded by angiography and who were not treated with anti-platelet medication served as controls (n\u00a0=\u00a032). Platelet aggregation was determined by impedance aggregometry using the Multiplate\u00ae point of care device. Drug response was differentiated by stimulation of whole blood with arachidonic acid (AA, ASA responsiveness) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP, clopidogrel responsiveness). P2Y12 receptor expression was determined by RT-PCR. ADP induced platelet aggregation correlated with the leukocyte count (r\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) suggesting that platelets and leukocytes interact functionally. Clopidogrel treatment abolished the influence of leukocytes on platelets and caused decreased leukocyte activation. We detected the expression of the clopidogrel target P2Y12 on leukocytes suggesting that clopidogrel may act directly on these cells and not only on platelets. In contrast to ASA responsiveness, clopidogrel response correlated with body mass index (r\u00a0=\u00a00.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In conclusion, (1) leukocytes influence ADP induced platelet aggregation most likely by expression of the P2Y12 receptor. This interaction is abolished by clopidogrel.

AIM The objective of the study is to highlight the advantages and limitations of transciliary supraorbital keyhole craniotomy for clipping of these aneurysms.   MATERIALS AND METHODS We present our experience with 55 intracranial aneurysms in the anterior circulation in 52 consecutive patients (23 females and 29 males, age range 22-70 years) operated between 2003 and 2009. All these aneurysms were clipped by a supraorbital transciliary incision and a craniotomy measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm. One patient required bilateral keyhole craniotomies for bilateral aneurysms.   RESULTS Of the 52 patients, 37 patients were in Grade I/II, and the rest were in Grade III-IV. Clipping could be done in all the patients, and in twelve patients there was intraoperative rupture of the aneurysm. While there was a learning curve, no limitations were apparent, and none of the patients required revision of the procedure or wrapping. None of the patients had suboptimal clip application. Postoperative check angiogram showed obliteration of the aneurysm in all the patients. Patients with preoperative Grade I/II could be discharged from the hospital within seven days, and cosmetic result was excellent in all the patients.

DESIGN A parallel randomised controlled trial was used to examine point of need access to specialist care via the nurse specialist, compared to routine hospital based 6-monthly clinical review at year two post breast cancer diagnosis. A total of 237 patients were recruited to the study.   METHODS Outcome measures at baseline, 9 and 18 months included psychological morbidity using the GHQ12 questionnaire, quality of life using the FACT-B plus endocrine subscale, fear and isolation. An analysis of covariance was used to detect changes over time. Recurrences and methods of detection were recorded as secondary outcome measures.   RESULTS Two hundred and fourteen patients completed the study. Overall patients were not exposed to risks of increased psychological morbidity (p=0.767) or decline of quality of life (p=0.282) when routine review was discontinued and no significant differences were detected during an 18-month period. Patients not receiving regular review did not feel isolated, and at the end of 18 months did not wish to return to 6-monthly clinical reviews. The presentation of recurrences and short symptom history demonstrate that the recurrences observed were unlikely to have been detected at a routine visit.   CONCLUSIONS Point of need access is acceptable to the majority of patients. Although a third of patients may wish to maintain a regular review, patient choice is important.

Guideline compliance in individual practices must be evaluated to implement improvements in the care of patients with this disease state. Objective: To evaluate compliance with osteoporosis treatment guidelines by physicians and patients at 2 family medicine clinics affiliated with a large university teaching hospital. Methods: Postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older with the ICD-9 diagnosis code 733.0 for osteoporosis during the study period between July 2006 and July 2007 were identified through the family medicine electronic medical record (EMR). Of 133 patients, 113 were eligible for inclusion. A retrospective chart review was conducted and prospective voluntary telephone surveys were administered. The EMR of each eligible patient was examined for presence of a baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan as well as appropriate follow-up DXA monitoring, appropriateness of osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and fracture history. The telephone survey was used to assess the patients' calcium use, nonpharmacologic recommendations received, and fracture incidence after diagnosis of osteoporosis. Results: Of 113 patients diagnosed with osteoporosis, 68 of 82 (82.9%) had appropriate baseline DXA scans; however, only 9 (13.2%) of these 68 patients had appropriate follow-up scans every 2 years thereafter.

METHODS The investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study carried out at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The sample comprised 155 male alcohol-dependent outpatients (52 non-smokers and 103 smokers), 18-60 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence. After a 1-week detoxification period, the patients randomly received placebo, naltrexone (50mg/day) or topiramate (up to 300 mg/day).

We hypothesised that blocking the AMPA receptor by caroverine in healthy men would impair their perception of neuroglycopenia and thereby diminish hormonal counter-regulation as well as symptoms of hypoglycaemia, as a model of stress.MethodsIn a balanced double-blind study, two hypoglycaemic clamp sessions (mean blood glucose 2.4\u00a0mmol/l for 50\u00a0min) were performed in ten healthy men during intravenous administration of 80\u00a0mg caroverine or placebo.

Maximal leg extensor muscle showed statistically significant differences between healthy controls and cardiac patients as well as between subgroups of patients: Physically inactive patients showed lowest torques (male: 148 \u00b1 18 Nm; female: 82 \u00b1 25 Nm) while highest values were measured in control subjects (male: 167 \u00b1 16 Nm; female: 93 \u00b1 17 Nm). In contrast, arm flexor muscles did not show any significant influence of health status or sports history. This qualitative difference between weight-bearing leg muscles and the muscle group of the upper extremity suggest that lower skeletal muscle strength in heart patients is mainly a consequence of selective disuse of leg muscles rather than any pathological skeletal muscle metabolism. Since a certain level of skeletal muscle strength is a prerequisite to cope with everyday activities, strength training is recommended as an important part of cardiac rehabilitation.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 16}, {"paper_id": "78cadfaab93e289cc94094a92eb74ff1016ce7ec", "text": "BACKGROUND Headache is the most frequent neurological symptom and the most common manifestation of pain in childhood.

METHOD A total of 1037 school children between the ages of 12 and 15 years were surveyed, of whom 49% were female. Main outcome measures were headache frequency, disease-specific impact using the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS), and generic quality of life impact using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL4).   RESULTS Twenty per cent of the study population had headache one or more times a week, with an average PedMIDAS score of over 12.1 (and an impact on over 12 days in a 3-month period). Ten per cent of the population had a PedMIDAS score of 16.8 and a PedsQL4 generic quality of life score of 70.1, indicating a poorer quality of life than that of children with asthma, diabetes, or cancer.

Animal and clinical data suggest beneficial hemodynamic and renal effects from vasodilation. We determined safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of human Relaxin in stable HF.   METHODS AND RESULTS Sixteen patients were treated with open-label intravenous Relaxin in 3 dose-escalation cohorts and monitored hemodynamically for 24-hour infusion and postinfusion periods and followed until Day 30. The safety demonstrated in Group A (8-hour sequential infusions at dose levels of 10, then 30, and then 100 microg x kg x day equivalents) allowed escalation to Group B (240, 480, and 960 microg x kg x day). The highest safe dose, 960 microg x kg x day, was selected for a 24-hour infusion in Group C. Relaxin showed no adverse effects; produced hemodynamic effects consistent with vasodilation (ie, trends toward increases in cardiac index, decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure, and decreases in circulating NT-pro BNP without inducing hypotension; improved markers of renal function [creatinine, blood urea nitrogen]). The highest dose caused a transient elevation in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen at Day 9 that was without apparent clinical significance.

A small fraction of non-squamous cell lung cancers harbor EGFR mutations, with improved outcome to gefitinib and erlotinib. Experimental evidence suggests that BRCA1 overexpression enhances sensitivity to docetaxel and resistance to cisplatin. RAP80 and Abraxas are interacting proteins that form complexes with BRCA1 and could modulate the effect of BRCA1. In order to further examine the effect of EGFR mutations and BRCA1 mRNA levels on outcome in advanced NSCLC, we performed a prospective non-randomized phase II clinical trial, testing the hypothesis that customized therapy would confer improved outcome over non-customized therapy. In an exploratory analysis, we also examined the effect of RAP80 and Abraxas mRNA levels. Methodology/Principal Findings We treated 123 metastatic non-squamous cell lung carcinoma patients using a customized approach. RNA and DNA were isolated from microdissected specimens from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Patients with EGFR mutations received erlotinib, and those without EGFR mutations received chemotherapy with or without cisplatin based on their BRCA1 mRNA levels: low, cisplatin plus gemcitabine; intermediate, cisplatin plus docetaxel; high, docetaxel alone. An exploratory analysis examined RAP80 and Abraxas expression. Median survival exceeded 28 months for 12 patients with EGFR mutations, and was 11 months for 38 patients with low BRCA1, 9 months for 40 patients with intermediate BRCA1, and 11 months for 33 patients with high BRCA1. Two-year survival was 73.3%, 41.2%, 15.6% and 0%, respectively. Median survival was influenced by RAP80 expression in the three BRCA1 groups. For example, for patients with both low BRCA1 and low RAP80, median survival exceeded 26 months. RAP80 was a significant factor for survival in patients treated according to BRCA1 levels (hazard ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1\u20131.7]; P\u200a=\u200a0.05). Conclusions/Significance Chemotherapy customized according to BRCA1 expression levels is associated with excellent median and 2-year survival for some subsets of NSCLC patients , and RAP80 could play a crucial modulating effect on this model of customized chemotherapy.

This study uses data from the CATIE schizophrenia trial to evaluate the hypothesis that drugs that were dosed somewhat higher in the trial than in typical practice would show greater efficacy and more side effects, especially at high capsule levels, than drugs that were dosed at lower relative strengths.   METHODS CATIE was a large (N=1460) randomized trial comparing 5 antipsychotics in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The blind was maintained in CATIE by prescribing identical-looking capsules of each medication. Dosing was flexible, such that PIs could prescribe from one to four capsules per day, and could modify the dose based on a patient's symptoms and side effects. Capsule strengths for olanzapine (7.5 mg) and quetiapine (200 mg) were relatively higher than for risperidone (1.5 mg), perphenazine (8 mg) or ziprasidone (40 mg). Proportional hazards models of time to all cause discontinuation and mixed regression models for continuous measures of symptoms, quality of life and side effects were used to test for interactions between randomly assigned drug and number of capsules prescribed per visit. We hypothesized that if a dosing bias was present, the flex-dosing design would result in a significant interaction such that drugs with higher relative dosing per capsule would be more effective and have more side effects than drugs with lower relative dosing and that this effect would be greatest at the largest prescribed dosing regimen (4 capsules).   RESULTS There were no significant interactions between drug assignment and number of capsules in the proportional hazards analyses of time to all cause discontinuation (p=.77, excluding ziprasidone and .74 in the ziprasidone cohort) or in the mixed model analysis of PANSS symptoms (p=.49), quality of life (p=.45); or measures of tardive dyskinesia (AIMS, p=.47).

Paired comparisons did not show the hypothesized pattern of relationships for akathisia or EPS, but such a pattern was suggested for olanzapine in the analysis of weight although it emerged at 2, 3 and 4 capsules indicating a general drug effect rather than a relative dosing difference.

DESIGN This was a prospective, multicenter study from 2001 to 2006.   SETTING The study was conducted at a network of seven university hospitals in Paris.   PATIENTS Seventy-seven patients were included. All underwent surgery because of hypersecretory and/or growing benign lesions (n = 18), obvious ACCs (n = 21), or radiologically indeterminate lesions (n = 38).   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The degree of (18)F-FDG PET uptake [maximum standardized uptake value (maxSUV)] was related to the pathological findings serving as a reference, and its diagnostic value was compared with that of computerized tomography (CT) scan.   RESULTS Pathology eventually diagnosed 43 ACAs, 22 ACCs, and 12 nonadrenocortical lesions.

It was considered unfavorable when a major amputation was necessary because of worsening of the lesion (wound spreading to any magnitude greater than the initial one) or the appearance of new wounds in the same leg.   RESULTS Both groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, level of arterial occlusion, type of lesion, anatomic localization of lesions and previous surgical procedures. The cumulative percentage of unfavorable results was significantly lower after treatment B with respect to treatment A (25.4% vs. 45.8%; p= 0.02), for a reduction of 44.5%. Four slight adverse reactions were associated with DMF: vertigo and nausea at the 7th treatment administration (one patient), and headache and tachycardia at the 12th dose (another patient). Blood hemoglobin and leukocyte counts and serum alanine transaminase were not affected.   CONCLUSION The treatment with DMF for 52 days as an adjuvant for the conventional therapy was associated with a lower need for major amputations. It was also well tolerated and safe.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 4}, {"paper_id": "5ad7b89dd791f7a34ab15d8b39d958396e572289", "text": "Objective: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) antiatherogenic functions seem to be diminished during inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition on the antioxidative capacity of HDL in RA. Methods: Plasma lipids and paraoxonase (PON-1) activity were investigated in 45 RA patients, before and during 6 months of anti-TNF therapy. In addition, HDL was isolated and tested for its ability to inhibit copper-induced oxidation of low-density lipoprotein in vitro. Results: Plasma HDL concentrations did not change considerably after 6 months of therapy. However, stable increases of PON-1 activities were observed throughout the same period (p<0.03). The increases were more obvious when related to HDL or apolipoprotein AI concentrations. HDL total antioxidative capacity significantly improved 6 months after the initiation of anti-TNF therapy (p\u200a=\u200a0.015). The initial improvement of PON-1 activity paralleled a decrease in the inflammatory status, whereas specific TNF blockade was likely to be responsible for the long-term effects. Conclusions: Anti-TNF therapy with infliximab has beneficial effects on lipids through changes in HDL antioxidative capacity, which might be clinically relevant and contribute to the reported protective effect of anti-TNF on cardiovascular morbidity in RA. This emphasises the importance of HDL antiatherogenic capacity for cardiovascular risk in chronic inflammatory conditions.", "1_year_count": 21, "label": 97}, {"paper_id": "dc5ab002adfd950d14e63dce3cefe066b5d3fbe8", "text": "BACKGROUND In patients with type 2 diabetes, glycemic control to target goals can only be achieved for a while by single-drug treatment. Antidiabetes therapy has to be adapted according to the individual course of the disease. This trial investigates the impact of Competact (Takeda Pharma, Aachen, Germany) (marketed as ActoplusMet in the United States)-a fixed combination of 850 mg of metformin with 15 mg of pioglitazone-for diabetes treatment in patients with insufficient glycemic control by metformin alone.   STUDY DESIGN This observational drug monitoring trial was performed at 1,480 study sites in Germany, and 4,866 complete patient data sets were included into the final analyses. Mean +/- SD age was 60.8 +/- 9.6 years (2,171 women, 2,691 men; disease duration, 6.7 +/- 4.7 years; body mass index [BMI], 31.0 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)). In total, 43.8% of the patients received lipid-lowering drugs (antihypertensive medication, 74.3%). Main inclusion criteria were type 2 diabetes, metformin monotherapy, and an initial hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value between 6.6% and 9.9%. Parameters of glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose [FBG]), blood pressure (BP), inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), and lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides) were collected at baseline and after 4 months.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A single 1,500-mg, oral dose of lapatinib was administered to 27 patients with advanced solid tumors on each of three occasions that were 1 week apart, in random order: after an overnight fast, with a low-fat breakfast, and with a high-fat breakfast.   RESULTS The low-fat breakfast produced mean increases in lapatinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 167% (2.67-fold) and maximum concentration (C(max)) of 142% (2.42-fold). The high-fat breakfast produced mean increases in lapatinib AUC of 325% (4.25-fold) and C(max) of 203% (3.03-fold) compared with the fasted state. Increased bioavailability in the fed state did not significantly decrease relative variability. Therefore, absolute variability in systemic exposure was increased.   CONCLUSION These large increases in lapatinib bioavailability and absolute variability support the recommendation for dosing in the fasted state to achieve consistent therapeutic exposure.

However, little is known about natural changes in ETS exposure over time in children with asthma and how these changes may affect health-care utilization. This article documents the relationship between changes in ETS exposure and childhood asthma morbidity among children enrolled in a clinical trial of supervised asthma therapy.   METHODS Data for this analysis come from a large randomized clinical trial of supervised asthma therapy in which 290 children with persistent asthma were randomized to receive either usual care or supervised asthma therapy. No smoking cessation counseling or ETS exposure education was provided to caregivers; however, children were given 20 min of asthma education, which incorporated discussion of the avoidance of asthma triggers, including ETS. Asthma morbidity and ETS exposure data were collected from caregivers via telephone interviews at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up.   RESULTS At baseline, 28% of caregivers reported ETS exposure in the home and 19% reported exposure outside of the primary household only. Among children whose ETS exposure decreased from baseline, fewer hospitalizations (p = 0.034) and emergency department (ED) visits (p < or = 0.001) were reported in the 12 months prior to the second interview compared to the 12 months prior to the first interview. Additionally, these children were 48% less likely (p = 0.042) to experience an episode of poor asthma control (EPAC).   CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to demonstrate an association between ETS exposure reduction and fewer EPACs, respiratory-related ED visits, and hospitalizations. These findings emphasize the importance of ETS exposure reduction as a mechanism to improve asthma control and morbidity.

Methodology/Principal Findings This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical research center-based, outpatient study in San Francisco. 40 HIV\u2013positive men (20 creatine, 20 placebo) enrolled in a 14-week study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive creatine monohydrate or placebo for 14 weeks. Treatment began with a loading dose of 20 g/day or an equivalent number of placebo capsules for 5 days, followed by maintenance dosing of 4.8 g/day or placebo. Beginning at week 2 and continuing to week 14, all subjects underwent thrice-weekly supervised resistance exercise while continuing on the assigned study medication (with repeated 6-week cycles of loading and maintenance). The main outcome measurements included muscle strength (one repetition maximum), energetics (31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy), composition and size (magnetic resonance imaging), as well as total body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). Thirty-three subjects completed the study (17 creatine, 16 placebo). Strength increased in all 8 muscle groups studied following PRT, but this increase was not augmented by creatine supplementation (average increase 44 vs. 42%, difference 2%, 95% CI \u22129.5% to 13.9%) in creatine and placebo, respectively). There were no differences between groups in changes in muscle energetics. Thigh muscle cross-sectional area increased following resistance exercise, with no additive effect of creatine. Lean body mass (LBM) increased to a significantly greater extent with creatine. Conclusions / Significance Resistance exercise improved muscle size, strength and function in HIV-infected men. While creatine supplementation produced a greater increase in LBM, it did not augment the robust increase in strength derived from PRT.

Many groups have suggested noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) to be a potential indication for limited resection.   METHODS We designed a prospective phase II study evaluating limited resection for noninvasive BAC diagnosed by intraoperative pathologic examination. From 1999 to 2007, limited resection was the procedure in 46 patients (16 men and 30 women; median age, 69 years; range, 49 to 83) who were diagnosed intraoperatively as having noninvasive BAC. The first end point was the predictive value of the intraoperative pathologic examination for noninvasive BAC diagnosis. The second end point was overall survival, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.   RESULTS We performed wedge resections for 44 patients and segmentectomy for 2 patients. Permanent pathologic examination revealed 3 patients had primary lung adenocarcinomas other than noninvasive BAC. The predictive value of intraoperative pathologic examination for noninvasive BAC diagnosis was 94%. During a median 51-month follow-up, there were only 2 cancer unrelated deaths. The 5-year overall survival rate and the disease-free survival rate were 93%, and the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 100%.   CONCLUSIONS The results of our prospective phase II study indicate that limited resection, mainly by wedge resection, is a potentially curative surgical procedure and may be an acceptable alternative to lobectomy for patients with noninvasive BAC.

Here we report its efficacy in patients with severe AD.   METHODS Between December, 2003, and March, 2007, patients aged 84 (SD 6) years with severe AD (mini-mental state examination [MMSE] score 5-12 points), in a nursing home setting were randomly assigned to receive galantamine (n=207), titrated initially to 24 mg/day, or placebo (n=200). Co-primary efficacy measures for cognitive function and ability to undertake normal daily activities were the severe impairment battery (SIB) and the seven-item minimum data set-activities of daily living (MDS-ADL), respectively. Adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters, and electrocardiograms were monitored. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00216593.   FINDINGS 168 of 207 (81%) patients in the galantamine group and 161 of 200 (81%) in the placebo group completed the study. Mean SIB scores increased (improved) by 1.9 (95% CI -0.1 to 3.9) points with galantamine and decreased (worsened) by 3.0 (-5.6 to -0.5) points with placebo (between-group least squares mean difference 4.36, 1.3 to 7.5; p=0.006).

By replacing well established heart monitoring devices (i.e. Holter) with wireless ECG based Body Area Networks (BAN), improved healthcare performance can be achieved, reflected in (1) high quality ECG recordings during physical activities and (2) increased patient satisfaction. A small scale clinical trial was conducted to compare both technologies and the results illustrate that the wireless ECG monitor was able to detect ECG signals intended for arrhythmia diagnostics. Furthermore, from a patient\u2019s perspective, both technologies were evaluated using three dimensions, namely; hygienic aspects, physical activity, and skin reactions. Results demonstrate that the wireless ECG BAN showed better performance, especially regarding the hygienic aspects. It was also favourable for use during physical activities, and the signal quality of the wireless sensor system demonstrated good performance regarding signal noise and artefact disturbances.

PATIENTS AND METHODS After curatively intentioned surgery, patients with stage II and III colon cancer were randomly allocated surgery to receive LV5FU2 (LV 200 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion, followed by FU; as a 400 mg/m(2) bolus and then a 600 mg/m(2) continuous infusion over 22 hours, days 1 and 2, every 2 weeks for 12 cycles: de Gramont regimen) with or without irinotecan (180 mg/m(2) as a 30- to 90-minute infusion, day 1, every 2 weeks). In total, 260 (7.9%) of 3,278 patients received an alternative high-dose infusional FU/LV regimen (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internische Onkologie regimen) with or without irinotecan. Results The principal efficacy analysis was based on 2,094 treated patients with stage III disease, randomly allocated in the LV5FU2 strata.

Height, weight, BMI, waist/hip ratio, age at menarche, years since menopause in case of postmenopausal women, history of disease, and fracture, if any, were recorded. BMD assessment was done on calcaneous by peripheral ultrasound bone densitometery on Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer and T-scores were calculated.

In this randomised, double-blind trial, we compared degree of pain between standard radiocolloid injection and pH-adjusted and lidocaine-supplemented formulations for patients undergoing SLN mapping for breast cancer.   METHODS Between Jan 13, 2006, and April 30, 2009, 140 patients with early breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 fashion to receive the standard topical 4% lidocaine cream and injection of [(99m)Tc]Tc-sulfur colloid (n=35), or to one of three other study groups: topical placebo cream and injection of Tc-sulfur colloid containing either sodium bicarbonate (n=35), 1% lidocaine (n=35), or sodium bicarbonate and 1% lidocaine (n=35).

The present study evaluates BPTB grafts fixed with metallic interference screws and DLSG grafts fixed with Bone Mulch Screw on the femur and WasherLoc fixation on the tibia. All else being the same, there is no difference in the outcome between the two grafts and fixation methods. This is a prospective randomized multicenter study.

This therapy involved intravenously injecting patients 3 days after liver transplantation with liver allograft-derived lymphocytes treated with IL-2 and the CD3-specific mAb OKT3. During the first month after liver transplantation, the HCV RNA titers in the sera of recipients who received immunotherapy were markedly lower than those in the sera of recipients who did not receive immunotherapy. We further explored these observations in human hepatocyte-chimeric mice, in which mouse hepatocytes were replaced by human hepatocytes. These mice unfailingly developed HCV infections after inoculation with HCV-infected human serum.

Relative to placebo, all treatment arms permitted lower respiratory rates at peak exercise. Heliox, with or without NIV, was associated with significant improvements in oxyhemoglobin saturation at peak exercise, relative to placebo or NIV alone.   CONCLUSIONS The adjunctive use of NIV with heliox during exercise proved both safe and tolerable in patients with severe COPD.

We investigated whether breathing HH would allow patients to perform a greater intensity of exercise and improve the benefits of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.   METHODS Thirty-eight nonhypoxemic patients with COPD (FEV(1)=47 +/- 17%(pred)) were randomized to rehabilitation breathing HH (60:40 He:O(2); n = 19) or air (n = 19). Patients cycled for 30 min, 3 days/week for 6 weeks breathing the assigned gas. Exercise intensity was prescribed from baseline, gas-specific, incremental exercise tests and was advanced as tolerated. The primary outcome was exercise tolerance assessed as a change in constant-load exercise time (CLT) following rehabilitation. Secondary outcomes were changes in exertional symptoms, health related quality of life (as assessed by the Short-form 36 and St George respiratory questionnaires), and peak oxygen consumption during an incremental exercise test.   RESULTS The HH group had a greater change in CLT following rehabilitation compared to the air group (9.5 +/- 9.1 vs 4.3 +/- 6.3 min, p < 0.05). At an exercise isotime, dyspnea was significantly reduced in both groups, while leg discomfort only decreased in the HH group. The changes in exertional symptoms and peak oxygen consumption were not different between groups. Health-related quality of life significantly improved in both groups; however, the change in St. George respiratory questionnaire total score was greater with HH (-7.6 +/- 6.4 vs -3.6 +/- 5.6, p < 0.05).

In addition, emerging data suggest that K-ras mutations are a negative predictor of clinical benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment in mCRC. Previously reported data suggest that the longer overall survival (OS) observed with bevacizumab treatment in mCRC is independent of alterations in the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. We conducted additional analyses to better describe the clinical benefit of bevacizumab treatment in mCRC relative to K-ras mutation status.   PATIENTS AND METHODS Additional statistical analyses were done with data from K-ras mutation analyses in 230 patients who were treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL) in combination with either bevacizumab or placebo in a randomized phase III study. Following microdissection, tissue was subject to DNA sequencing to identify K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 13. Hazard ratios for the bevacizumab group relative to the control group were estimated from an unstratified Cox regression model. The median progression-free survival (PFS), OS times, and objective response rates were compared.   RESULTS K-ras status was assessed in 230 patients (28.3%). The median PFS was significantly longer in bevacizumab-treated patients with wild-type (wt)- (13.5 versus 7.4 months; hazard ratio 0.44, p < .0001) and mutant (m)-K-ras (9.3 versus 5.5 months; hazard ratio 0.41, p = .0008). A significantly higher response rate for IFL plus bevacizumab was observed only in wt-K-ras patients (60.0% versus 37.3%, p = .006) compared with 43.2% versus 41.2% in the m-K-ras group.

This significance was maintained on multivariate analysis. Those who had problems learning about their medical condition due to difficulties understanding written information had poorer scores on the QOLIE-10, increased seizure frequency, and lower educational levels on univariate analysis.

Methods. This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up. Twenty-seven hemiplegic subjects with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to receive 20-session wrist training with a continuous electromyography (EMG)-driven robot (interactive group, n = 15) and a passive motion device (passive group, n = 12), completed within 7 consecutive weeks.

Limb rescue rate after surgical revascularization is relatively poor compared with patients with normal renal function. Prostanoids are an interesting category as adjuvants to revascularization. New vessel growth develops not exclusively by proliferation of endothelial cells in vascular extremities but also by cells mobilized from the bone marrow (HSC), transformed into endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contributing to both re-endothelialization and neovascularization. Basal number of HSC and EPC is significantly reduced in HD patients and correlated with a subsequent defective neovascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of perioperative treatment with iloprost in uremic patients with acute ischemia of lower limbs, undergoing surgical revascularization, on endothelial progenitor cells, hypothesizing a possible biological mechanism induced by the prostanoids. A search was also made for vascular remodeling processes through the analysis of the concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (i-CAM, v-CAM, e-selectin), biochemical markers of endothelial activation. Thirty HD patients with SLI undergoing peripheral revascularization were enrolled (15 were treated with iloprost and 15 with a placebo). Iloprost was administered as an intra-arterial bolus of 3000 ng over 1 to 3 min immediately after revascularization and in the same affected artery. Serum samples were taken before revascularization (T0), at 6 (T6) and 24 h (T24) after infusion to measure sICAM-1, sE-selectin, and sVCAM-1, and for quantification of HSC and EPC. Progenitors were identified by specific surface markers CD34+, CD133+ and VEGFR2+. Count was conducted using PROCOUNT performed in a TRUCOUNT tube and with a FACSort flow cytometer. Before revascularization, all patients showed a decreased number of HSC and EPC. After 6 h, HSC augmented significantly compared with T0 in both groups. The iloprost group attained a significant increase compared with the placebo group. HSC levels reduced drastically at T24. EPC augmented significantly compared with basal level after 24 h. In the iloprost group, the increase was considerable compared with the placebo group. A close negative correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient (r), was found between HSC and EPC at T24 in the iloprost group (R = 0.82 P < 0.01). Adhesion molecules had increased levels at T6 and T24 in both groups. Moreover, a close positive correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient, was found between EPC and adhesion molecules in both groups but the iloprost group maintained a better statistical association. Revascularization stimulated HSC and EPC release from bone marrow but at a different time: HSC increased suddenly at 6 h and diminished to a minimal amount at T24, conversely, EPC increased significantly only at T24. Iloprost treatment was able to amplify this mechanism validating recent findings (North TE et al., [31]).

Given the limited evidence for the application of LMWH in this indication in daily practice, the authors conducted an open, prospective study in primary care. Primary endpoint of this study was a clinical sign of recurrent thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism 14 days after the end of DVT treatment with 1 mg/kg body weight enoxaparin twice daily. Secondary endpoint were bleeding complications during and up to 48 h after the end of enoxaparin treatment. Furthermore, risk factors were analyzed that may indicate later development of recurrent thrombosis.Patients and Methods:Consecutive inclusion of patients and documentation of use of enoxaparin in patients with diagnostically confirmed signs of DVT, which were eligible for outpatient treatment.Results:Between May 2004 and March 2005, 1,077 patients with DVT were recruited in 260 nationwide centers. 98.7% of thromboses were confirmed by diagnostic procedures. Recurrent thrombosis was observed in only 0.28% of patients (n = 3), and pulmonary embolism in further 0.37% (n = 4). 0.74% of the patients (n = 8) had minor (n = 7) and major (n = 1) bleeding complications with enoxaparin treatment.

Anti-T-cell globulins (ATGs) might lower the incidence of GVHD. We did a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial to compare standard GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and methotrexate with or without anti-Jurkat ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F).   METHODS Between May 26, 2003, and Feb 8, 2007, 202 patients with haematological malignancies were centrally randomly assigned using computer-generated centre-stratified block randomisation between treatment groups receiving ciclosporin and methotrexate with or without additional ATG-F. One patient in the ATG-F group did not undergo transplantation, thus 201 patients who underwent transplantation with peripheral blood (n=164; 82%) or bone marrow (n=37; 18%) grafts from unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning were included in the full analysis set, and were analysed according to their randomly assigned treatment (ATG-F n=103, control n=98). The primary endpoint was severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade III-IV or death within 100 days of transplantation. The trial is registered with the numbers DRKS00000002 and NCT00655343.   FINDINGS The number of patients in the ATG-F group who had severe aGVHD grade III-IV or who died within 100 days of transplantation was 12 and 10 (21.4%, 95% CI 13.4-29.3), respectively, compared with 24 and nine (33.7%, 24.3-43.0) patients, respectively, in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.30-1.17; p=0.13). The cumulative incidence of aGVHD grade III-IV was 11.7% (95% CI 6.8-19.8) in the ATG-F group versus 24.5% (17.3-34.7) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.25-1.01; p=0.054), and cumulative incidence of aGVHD grade II-IV was 33.0% (n=34; 95% CI 25.1-43.5) in the ATG-F group versus 51.0% (n=50; 95% CI 42.0-61.9) in the control group (adjusted HR 0.56, 0.36-0.87; p=0.011). The 2-year cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GVHD was 12.2% (n=11; 95% CI 7.0-21.3) versus 42.6% (n=34; 95% CI 33.0-55.0; adjusted HR 0.22, 0.11-0.43; p<0.0001). There were no differences between treatment groups with regard to relapse, non-relapse mortality, overall survival, and mortality from infectious causes.   INTERPRETATION The addition of ATG-F to GVHD prophylaxis with ciclosporin and methotrexate resulted in decreased incidence of acute and chronic GVHD without an increase in relapse or non-relapse mortality, and without compromising overall survival.

Few devices were designed and clinically tested for training coordinated movements of the wrist, which are crucial for achieving even the basic level of motor competence that is necessary for carrying out ADLs (activities of daily life). Moreover, most systems of robot therapy use point-to-point reaching movements which tend to emphasize the pathological tendency of stroke patients to break down goal-directed movements into a number of jerky sub-movements. For this reason we designed a wrist robot with a range of motion comparable to that of normal subjects and implemented a self-adapting training protocol for tracking smoothly moving targets in order to facilitate the emergence of smoothness in the motor control patterns and maximize the recovery of the normal RoM (range of motion) of the different DoFs (degrees of Freedom).MethodsThe IIT-wrist robot is a 3 DoFs light exoskeleton device, with direct-drive of each DoF and a human-like range of motion for Flexion/Extension (FE), Abduction/Adduction (AA) and Pronation/Supination (PS). Subjects were asked to track a variable-frequency oscillating target using only one wrist DoF at time, in such a way to carry out a progressive splinting therapy. The RoM of each DoF was angularly scanned in a staircase-like fashion, from the \"easier\" to the \"more difficult\" angular position. An Adaptive Controller evaluated online performance parameters and modulated both the assistance and the difficulty of the task in order to facilitate smoother and more precise motor command patterns.ResultsThree stroke subjects volunteered to participate in a preliminary test session aimed at verify the acceptability of the device and the feasibility of the designed protocol. All of them were able to perform the required task.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Maximal voluntary force and rate of rise of tension of hand grip, wrist extension, and elbow flexion and extension were recorded at all 3 times. At the same time, functional motor assessments were evaluated by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block test, and Rivermead Test.   RESULTS We found no correlation between maximal voluntary force increases of various muscle contractions measurements. Neither the increase of grip strength nor that of wrist extension force correlated with improvement in ARAT score.

METHODS Consecutive patients with suspected stroke were included in this prospective, controlled, single-center study. A well-trained stroke center triage nurse assigned a probability that the patient had experienced a stroke (certain, very probable, probable, not likely, doubtful, or other); then, the Triage Stroke Panel testing was performed. Patients' diagnosis was based on clinical and imaging data by a neurologist blinded to the test results.   RESULTS Two hundred four patients were evaluated. Confirmed strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were observed in 131 patients. When considering an experienced stroke nurse's assessment of \"other,\" \"doubtful,\" or \"not likely\" to be negative for stroke and categorizing TIA with stroke, the stroke panel's Multimarker Index (MMX) value had identical accuracy (approximately 70%) and equivalent sensitivity (approximately 94%) and specificity (approximately 24%) for stroke diagnosis to that of the nurse. Combining nurse assessment with the MMX result significantly improved the specificity of diagnosing \"mimic\" vs stroke + TIA from 25.4% (nurse assessment only) to 46.0% (nurse assessment + MMX; P < .001).

Reference ranges for T cell populations in control patients negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were calculated using data from AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol A5113.   RESULTS Patients in the lower baseline CD4(+) strata did not achieve total CD4(+) cell counts similar to those of patients in the higher strata during 144 weeks of ART, although CD4(+) cell count increases were similar.

A significant message frame by CFC interaction was found indicating a loss frame advantage for participants high in CFC and a gain frame advantage for those low in CFC. After reading the loss frame, participants high in CFC spent almost twice as long as those low in CFC reading the additional health information, whereas after reading the gain frame, participants low in CFC read longer than those high in CFC.

These outcomes were explored in a prospective survey of 100 patients with advanced COPD. Patients were recruited from two academic centers. The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 24.4% (standard deviation=3.9). Validated instruments were used to assess symptom distress (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale [MSAS]), mental health (Mental Health Inventory [MHI]-5), functional status (Sickness Impact Profile [SIP]), quality of life (Multidimensional Index of Life Quality [MILQ]), spirituality (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT] Spirituality Scale), and comorbid conditions (Charlson Comorbidity Index). The most prevalent symptoms were dyspnea (94%), fatigue (71%), xerostomia (60%), coughing (56%), and anxiety (51%). Other symptoms with high prevalence were drowsiness (47%), irritability (42%), feeling nervous (40%), and wheezing (40%). Significant pain was reported in about one-third of patients. Patients reported relatively high levels of overall functional impairment (SIP median=24.0) and modest impairment in overall quality of life (MILQ median=52). Overall, psychological well-being was relatively unimpaired (median=24.5), and the comfort derived from faith was intact (FACIT median=2.5). Impairment in quality of life was strongly associated with symptom distress (MSAS-GDI; r=-0.74, P<0.001), functional impairment (SIP total; r=-0.59, P<0.001), female sex (r=-0.26, P=0.01), and poor psychological well-being (MHI-5; r=0.68, P<0.001). In multivariate analyses, poor quality of life was strongly correlated with higher total symptom distress, sickness-related dysfunction, and lower levels of psychological well-being (R(2)=0.66).

Many of these cancers will not progress, and radical therapy may lead to substantial overtreatment. Active surveillance (AS) has emerged as an alternative.   OBJECTIVE To retrospectively validate the currently used criteria for eligibility for AS.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this cohort study, data from 616 men who were diagnosed with PCa between 1994 and 2007 at a mean age of 66.3 yr in four centres of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) were combined. All patients fit the criteria for AS (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < or = 10.0 ng/ml, PSA-density < 0.2 ng/ml per ml, stage T1C/T2, Gleason score < or = 3 + 3 = 6, and < or = 2 positive biopsy cores), and initially they were managed expectantly. Median follow-up was 3.91 yr.   MEASUREMENTS Disease specific-, overall-, and treatment-free survival were studied. Present PSA characteristics were assessed and also compared between men who were switching to deferred active therapy during follow-up and men remaining untreated.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The calculated (Kaplan-Meier) 10-yr PCa-specific survival (21 patients at risk) was 100%, which sharply contrasted with 77% overall survival. Men still alive showed favourable PSA characteristics. Although the calculated 10-yr treatment-free survival was only 43%, objective signs of progression often did not indicate the shift to radical treatment. The cohort consisted of men on AS and those on watchful waiting (WW); information on comorbidity or psychological distress was not available.   CONCLUSIONS AS seems justified in selected men with screen-detected PCa. Prospective protocol-based AS programs are necessary to optimise selection criteria and to find the appropriate trigger points for switching to active therapy.

Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown. Our aim was to test the effectiveness of BP-DBS in adults with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP.   METHODS We did a multicentre prospective pilot study of BP-DBS in 13 adults with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP who had no cognitive impairment, little spasticity, and only slight abnormalities of the basal ganglia on MRI. The primary endpoint was change in the severity of dystonia-choreoathetosis after 1 year of neurostimulation, as assessed with the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale. The accuracy of surgical targeting to the GPi was assessed masked to the results of neurostimulation. Analysis was by intention to treat.   FINDINGS The mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale movement score improved from 44.2 (SD 21.1) before surgery to 34.7 (21.9) at 1 year post-operatively (p=0.009; mean improvement 24.4 [21.1]%, 95% CI 11.6-37.1). Functional disability, pain, and mental health-related quality of life were significantly improved. There was no worsening of cognition or mood. Adverse events were related to stimulation (arrest of the stimulator in one patient, and an adjustment to the current intensity in four patients). The optimum therapeutic target was the posterolateroventral region of the GPi. Little improvement was seen when the neurostimulation diffused to adjacent structures (mainly to the globus pallidus externus [GPe]).   INTERPRETATION Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. However, given the heterogeneity of motor outcomes and the small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. The optimum placement of the leads seemed to be a crucial, but not exclusive, factor that could affect a good outcome.

Because disease status after induction chemotherapy is variable, we evaluated the prognostic effect of disease status before ASCT, especially in patients who were initially chemosensitive. We retrospectively analyzed the initially chemosensitive MM patients (> or = partial remission [PR]) enrolled in the Korean Multiple Myeloma Working Party Web-based registration system (www.myeloma.or.kr). Between November 1996 and January 2007, 197 MM patients (median age 53 years) were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by a single ASCT. All patients received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support after conditioning with melphalan (Mel) alone. We considered those patients with no detectable M-protein regardless of the result of immunofixation to be in complete remission (CR) in this study. The median follow-up times were 29.2 months (range, 5.4 to 103.8 months) from the day of diagnosis and 22.4 months (range, 0.4 to 96.0 months) from the day of ASCT. Before ASCT, 63 patients (32%) were in CR and 134 (68%) were in partial remission (PR). The patients in CR had significantly longer overall survival (OS) from the day of ASCT compared with those in PR (P = .0015). Among the patients who received induction chemotherapy with vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (n = 162), the same difference in OS was seen between those in CR and those in PR before ASCT (P = .0016). CR after ASCT also predicted longer OS (P = .0135); however, patients with continued CR after ASCT had significantly higher OS after ASCT compared with patient with induced CR after ASCT who were in PR before ASCT (P = .0178). Multivariate analysis indicated that remission status pre-ASCT (CR vs PR) is a significant prognostic factor for predicting OS after ASCT (P = .012, Cox proportional hazard analysis; odds ratio = 2.83; 95% confidence interval = 1.25 to 6.37). We conclude that patients with MM who are in CR before ASCT have a better OS than those in PR before ASCT. Continued CR after ASCT may be an important prognostic factor as well.

The ISBRA symposium provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and results among researchers, developers, and practitioners working on all aspects of bioinformatics and computational biology and their applications. In 2012, 66 papers were submitted in response to the call for papers, out of which 26 papers appeared in the ISBRA proceedings published as volume 7292 of Springer Verlag\u2019s Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series. Extended versions of nine symposium papers were invited and accepted for publication in this special section following a rigorous review process. The selected papers cover a broad range of bioinformatics topics, including biological networks, computational complexity of problems in structural biology and genomics, and phylogenetic inference and analysis. Below, we briefly introduce each of them. The first paper by Xi Chen, Jianhua Xuan, Chen Wang, Ayesha N. Shajahan, Rebecca B. Riggins, and Robert Clarke describes a stability-based network component analysis (sNCA) to uncover regulatory networks by integrating gene expression data and binding motif information. The proposed sNCA approach overcomes a major limitation in many existing methods as caused by the inconsistency between gene expression data and TF-gene binding information. Experimental results on simulated and biological data show that sNCA achieves an improved and robust performance in TF identification as compared to the previously published NCA method and can help identify biologically meaningful regulatory networks associated with the development and progression of breast cancer. In the second paper, Matteo Re and Giorgio Valentini address an important problem in medical informatics, namely, identifying novel effects of existing therapeutic drugs by integrating heterogeneous types of network data on drug structure and effects. The authors explore various strategies for integrating such heterogeneous networks into a unified model and propose a novel scheme based on kernelized scoring functions for measuring similarity in these networks. Extensive cross-validation experiments are conducted on a data set of more than 1,200 FDA approved drugs to assess the effectiveness of various network integration approaches and scoring functions. The protein chain pair simplification problem (CPS-3F) was proposed in 2008 to simultaneously simplify both chains with respect to each other under the discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance. It is unknown whether CPS-3F is NP-complete. In the third paper of the special section, Timothy Wylie and Binhai Zhu define a constrained CPS-3F problem (CPS-3F+), and prove that it is polynomially solvable by presenting a dynamic programming solution. The authors also compare the CPS3F+ solutions with previous empirical results and demonstrate some of the benefits of the simplified comparisons. In the fourth paper, Laurent Bulteau and Minghui Jiang explore the approximation complexity (1, 2)-exemplar distance between genomes. Computing this distance from a genome without duplicate genes to the genome with at most one duplicate for each gene requires keeping just one copy of each gene in the second genome so as to minimize the distance between the two reduced genomes according to some measure. It is shown that this problem is hard to approximate for popular genome rearrangement measures (such as breakpoint distance, signed reversals, and signed double-cut-and-joins) and edit distance measures (such as Levenshtein and Hamming distances). They notice that no constant-factor approximation is known for any of these measures. The fifth paper by Daniele Catanzaro, Martine Labb\u00e9, and Bjarni Halld\u00f3rsson addresses the Parsimonious Loss of Heterozygosity Problem (PLOHP), which seeks to detect deletion polymorphisms based on unexpected patterns of loss of heterozygosity in a population. More specifically, PLOHP asks for partitioning putative polymorphisms of a set of individuals into the minimum number of deletion areas. The inferred deletion areas could provide fundamental insights for the development of new diagnostics and treatments. The paper presents a generalized PLOHP formulation which incorporates different recombination models and prior knowledge about the locations of deletions and reduces it to the clique partition problem in undirected catch-point interval graphs. Although the problem is shown to be NP-hard, a proposed integer programming formulation can exactly solve real instances in practical time.

ARF15 BID and ARF30 QD were associated with similar improvements from baseline in (FEV(1)AUC(0-24), LSM 0.15 and 0.16 L, respectively; Delta, 0.01 L; 90% CI, -0.02 to 0.04) and trough FEV(1) (LSM, 0.15 and 0.12 L, respectively; Delta, -0.03 L; 90% CI, -0.09 to 0.03). FEV(1)AUC(0-12) was improved more with ARF30 QD than ARF15 BID (Delta, 0.06 L; 90% CI, 0.04 to 0.09), and FEV(1)AUC(12-24) was improved more with ARF15 BID than ARF30 Qd (Delta, -0.04 L; 90% CI, -0.08 to 0.01). The 90% CI for FEV(1)AUC(0-24) for the treatment difference between ARF15 BID and ARF30 QD was within the prespecified range of -0.07 to 0.07 L, indicating that both treatments resulted in equivalent FEV(1)AUC(0-24) values.   CONCLUSIONS In these subjects with moderate to severe COPD, single-day administrations of ARF15 BID or ARF30 QD were associated with FEV(1) responses over a period of 24 hours that were considered equivalent per the protocol definition employed in the present study. FEV1 improvement over 12 hours was greater for ARF30 QD after the morning dose and for ARF15 BID after the evening dose.

However, their effect on ovarian cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers has only been investigated in a small number of studies. Methods: We used data on 2,281 BRCA1 carriers and 1,038 BRCA2 carriers from the International BRCA1/2 Carrier Cohort Study to evaluate the effect of reproductive and hormonal factors on ovarian cancer risk for mutation carriers. Data were analyzed within a weighted Cox proportional hazards framework. Results: There were no significant differences in the risk of ovarian cancer between parous and nulliparous carriers. For parous BRCA1 mutation carriers, the risk of ovarian cancer was reduced with each additional full-term pregnancy (P trend = 0.002). BRCA1 carriers who had ever used OC were at a significantly reduced risk of developing ovarian cancer (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence intervals, 0.37-0.73; P = 0.0002) and increasing duration of OC use was associated with a reduced ovarian cancer risk (P trend = 0.0004). The protective effect of OC use for BRCA1 mutation carriers seemed to be greater among more recent users. Tubal ligation was associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer for BRCA1 carriers (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence intervals, 0.22-0.80; P = 0.008). The number of ovarian cancer cases in BRCA2 mutation carriers was too small to draw definitive conclusions. Conclusions: The results provide further confirmation that OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, and tubal ligation are associated with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers to a similar relative extent as in the general population.

A phase 2b study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of maraviroc in combination with optimized background therapy in treatment-experienced patients infected with dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1.   METHODS Treatment-experienced patients with an HIV-1 RNA level 5000 copies/mL who had received 3 classes of drugs and/or were infected with virus resistant to 2 drug classes and were infected with non-R5 HIV-1 were randomized to receive optimized background therapy plus maraviroc (once or twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was change in HIV-1 RNA level from baseline to 24 weeks.   RESULTS Among 167 patients infected with dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1, baseline mean HIV-1 RNA levels were >5 log(10) copies/mL and median CD4(+) cell counts were <50 cells/microL. From baseline to 24 weeks, patients who received placebo demonstrated a mean decrease in HIV-1 RNA levels of 0.97 log(10) copies/mL, compared with mean decreases of 0.91 and 1.20 log(10) copies/mL for those who received maraviroc once (P =.83) or twice (P +.38) daily, respectively. Mean increases in CD4(+) cell counts from baseline were 36 cells/microL for patients who received placebo, 60 cells/microL among patients who received maraviroc once daily, and 62 cells/microL among patients who received maraviroc twice daily. The incidences of serious adverse events were similar among groups.   CONCLUSIONS In this exploratory study involving extensively treatment-experienced patients with advanced, non-R5 HIV-1 infection, neither superiority nor noninferiority was statistically demonstrated for either maraviroc dosage compared with placebo at 24 weeks of treatment.

Plans for fixed beam IMRT, single (RA1) and double (RA2) modulated arcs with the RapidArc technique were optimised. Dose prescription was set to 66 Gy to the primary tumour (at 2.2 Gy/fraction), 60 Gy to intermediate-risk nodes and 54 Gy to low-risk nodal levels. The planning objectives for PTV were minimum dose >95%, and maximum dose <107%. Maximum dose to spinal cord was limited to 46 Gy, maximum to brain stem to 50 Gy. For parotids, mean dose <26 Gy (or median <30 Gy) was assumed as the objective. The MU and delivery time were scored to measure expected treatment efficiency.   RESULTS Target coverage and homogeneity results improved with RA2 plans compared to both RA1 and IMRT. All the techniques fulfilled the objectives on maximum dose, while small deviations were observed on minimum dose for PTV. The conformity index (CI(95%)) was 1.7+/-0.2 for all the three techniques. RA2 allowed a reduction of D(2%) to spinal cord of approximately 3 Gy compared to IMRT (RA1 D(2%) increased it of approximately 1 Gy). On brain stem, D(2%) was reduced from 12 Gy (RA1 vs. IMRT) to 13.5 Gy (RA2 vs. IMRT). The mean dose to ipsi-lateral parotids was reduced from 40 Gy (IMRT) to 36.2 Gy (RA1) and 34.4 Gy (RA2).

Even if most patients benefit from tamoxifen, many breast tumours either fail to respond or become resistant. Because tamoxifen is extensively metabolised by polymorphic enzymes, one proposed mechanism underlying the resistance is altered metabolism. In the present study we investigated the prognostic and/or predictive value of functional polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 3A5 CYP3A5 (*3), CYP2D6 (*4), sulphotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1; *2) and UDPglucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15; *2) in tamoxifentreated patients with breast cancer. Methods In all, 677 tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal patients with breast cancer, of whom 238 were randomised to either 2 or 5 years of tamoxifen, were genotyped by using PCR with restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results The prognostic evaluation performed in the total population revealed a significantly better disease-free survival in patients homozygous for CYP2D6*4. For CYP3A5, SULT1A1 and UGT2B15 no prognostic significance was observed. In the randomised group we found that for CYP3A5, homozygous carriers of the *3 allele tended to have an increased risk of recurrence when treated for 2 years with tamoxifen, although this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68 to 11.99, P = 0.15). In the group randomised to 5 years' tamoxifen the survival pattern shifted towards a significantly improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) among CYP3A5*3-homozygous patients (HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.55, P = 0.002). No reliable differences could be seen between treatment duration and the genotypes of CYP2D6, SULT1A1 or UGT2B15. The significantly improved RFS with prolonged tamoxifen treatment in CYP3A5*3 homozygotes was also seen in a multivariate Cox model (HR = 0.13, CI = 0.02 to 0.86, P = 0.03), whereas no differences could be seen for CYP2D6, SULT1A1 and UGT2B15. Conclusion The metabolism of tamoxifen is complex and the mechanisms responsible for the resistance are unlikely to be explained by a single polymorphism; instead it is a combination of several mechanisms. However, the present data suggest that genetic variation in CYP3A5 may predict response to tamoxifen therapy.

Kidney transplant recipients are considered to have chronic kidney disease (CKD) irrespective of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or presence or absence of markers of kidney damage. The aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of CKD-stages and whether the guidelines for general population (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) are routinely followed in kidney transplant in Spain. Patients and Methods. Two thousand one hundred sixty renal transplant recipients followed up at the outpatient clinics in 4 University Hospitals were included. The estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated according to the abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease equation, and the patients were classified following the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stages. Results. Chronic kidney failure (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was present in 1505 patients (69.7%), 54.4% were 3T-stage (eGFR 30-59); 13.0% were 4T-stage (eGFR 15-30), and 2.3% were 5T-stage. The prevalence of severe anemia increased from 4.1% in 1T-stage to 44% in 5T-stage (P=0.000) as did the percentage of patients on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents from 1.3% to 68% (P=0.000). The intact parathyroid hormone levels increased as graft function declined and 45% of 5T-stage patients had intact parathyroid hormone levels more than 300.

Finally, the effect of FDC I/H on QOL scores, particularly in A-HeFT, is not known.   METHODS AND RESULTS A-HeFT randomized 1050 African-American patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV heart failure and systolic dysfunction. QOL measurements using Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) were done at baseline and 3-month intervals. At baseline, worse MLHFQ scores were associated with younger age, female sex, greater body mass index, nonischemic etiology, high heart rate and NYHA Class, low systolic blood pressure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Both baseline and change in MLHFQ score were associated with a higher risk for combined all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization (baseline P < .0001, change at 3 months P=.001, and at 6 months P=.0008), but not mortality.

We examined outcomes after conventional craniotomy and stereotactic fibrinolytic therapy in a series of patients with anticoagulant-associated hemorrhages.   METHODS Among 129 consecutive surgically treated patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, 27 patients with AAICH were identified (mean age 62; range 36-79). Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy for surgical hematoma evacuation, and 14 patients hematoma puncture and catheter placement for clot lysis. The groups had comparable major prognostic factors such as hematoma volume, age, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score at admission.   RESULTS Nine patients died despite treatment (mortality=33%). Mortality in the craniotomy group was comparable to that of the lysis group (46% versus 21%; p=0.13). Good outcomes (Glasgow outcome score of 4 or 5) were seen in 3 craniotomy patients (23%) and 2 fibrinolysis patients (14%). Half the patients survived with major neurological deficits (GOS 2 or 3) (n=13; 48%). One rebleed was observed two days after uneventful craniotomy and hematoma removal, while no patient who underwent fibrinolysis had rebleeding.

Despite recognition that parents have difficulty adapting to a palliative perspective there is little insight into this process. This study explored, from a parental perspective, the process parents go through when cure is no longer a possibility.Participants and methodsA multicenter study using qualitative research was undertaken during the EoL phase. One-time and repeated open interviews were conducted with 44 parents of 23 children with incurable cancer.ResultsFeelings of loss play a prominent role during the EoL phase. Dealing with loss is a process of stepwise relinquishing that becomes manifest in an internal struggle between preservation and letting go. Preservation means that parents try to maintain the child\u2019s status quo. Letting go means parents give up their resistance to loss in service of their child\u2019s well-being. Although the relative measure of each changes over time, parents have great difficulty making the transition because it implies a change in source of control. A timely completion of this transition positively influences the child\u2019s well-being as well as the evaluation of enacted parenthood.ConclusionFor parents the essence of the palliative process is not to accept death but to deal with the loss of their child. Although the need to avoid loss and gain control by means of preservation is fully understandable, the study indicated that parents who made the transition to letting go had an increased receptiveness of their child\u2019s real situation and needs.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 51}, {"paper_id": "49d7ee047aa17a086b845a713e789ab4f9fbfd20", "text": "OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of atomoxetine in improving ADHD and ODD symptoms in paediatric patients with ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), non-responders to previous psychological intervention with parent support.   METHODS This was a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients aged 6-15 years, with ADHD and ODD diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria by a structured clinical interview (K-SADS-PL). Only subjects who are non-responders to a 6-week standardized parent training were randomised to atomoxetine (up to 1.2 mg/kg/day) or placebo (in a 3:1 ratio) for the following 8-week double blind phase.   RESULTS Only 2 of the 156 patients enrolled for the parent support phase (92.9% of males; mean age: 9.9 years), improved after the parent training program; 139 patients were randomised for entering in the study and 137 were eligible for efficacy analysis.

In single or \u201cstraight\u201d vessel segments, the arterial and reference diameter directions were made independent of each other in order to be able to measure the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) more accurately, especially in curved vessel segments. For ostial segments, an extension of this approach was used, to allow measurement of ostial lesions in sidebranches more proximal than using conventional methods. Furthermore, two new bifurcation approaches were developed. The validation study shows that the straight segment approach results in significant smaller MLDs (on average 0.032\u00a0mm) and the ostial approach achieves on average an increase in %DS of 3.8% and an increase in lesion length of 0.59\u00a0mm due to loosening the directional constraint. The validation of our new bifurcation approaches in phantom data as well as clinical data shows only small differences between pre- and post-intervention measurements of the reference diameters outside the bifurcation core (errors smaller than 0.06\u00a0mm) and the bifurcation core area (errors smaller than 1.4% for phantom data).

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an active control arm, the hypotensive action of time-released garlic powder tablets (Allicor) was compared with that of regular garlic pills (Kwai) in 84 men with mild or moderate arterial hypertension.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group conducted a Phase II trial of autologous HSCT followed by NST to provide maximal tumor cytoreduction to allow for a subsequent GVM effect. Patients received melphalan 200 mg/m(2) with autologous HSCT, followed by fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) in 5 daily doses and cyclophosphamide 1 g/m(2) in 2 daily doses with matched sibling donor NST.

By applying previously defined cutoff values, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 58% with a specificity of 50% for TDI and a sensitivity of 95% with a specificity of 87% for RT3DE to predict clinical response to CRT. For prediction of reverse remodeling after CRT, sensitivity and specificity were 59% and 50% for TDI, and 88% and 60% for RT3DE, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for systolic dyssynchrony index by RT3DE of 6.7% yielded a sensitivity of 90% with a specificity of 87% to predict clinical response, and a sensitivity of 88% with a specificity of 70% to predict reverse remodeling.   CONCLUSION Marked differences between techniques are found for the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony when current cutoff values are applied, making interchangeability of these techniques uncertain.

The entorhinal cortex and the olfactory bulb, critical areas for olfactory function, are rich in acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter implicated in AD pathology and treatment. In view of the common anatomical substrate, we aimed to determine whether performance on an olfaction test can be used as a clinical marker for monitoring the efficacy of donepezil in elderly people with AD. Methods: Twenty-five participants with mild to moderate AD, planned for donepezil treatment, were recruited from mental health services for older adults in this open-labeled study. Assessments before commencing donepezil included Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Bristol Activities of Daily Living, and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. After 3 months of treatment, the primary outcome measure, the Clinician Interview Based Impression of Change plus caregiver input (CIBIC-plus), was completed, and the baseline assessments were repeated. Results: Eighteen patients continued to receive donepezil at follow-up. The CIBIC-plus outcome correlated with changes in University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and Bristol Activities of Daily Living scores from the baseline (r = 0.7, P < 0.01). In addition, it was the change in smell identification function after treatment that best predicted CIBIC-plus outcome (P < 0.05) on ordinal regression analysis.

The addition of thalidomide to this combination demonstrated a survival benefit for patients age 65 to 75 years. This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial investigated the efficacy of melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide in patients older than 75 years with newly diagnosed myeloma.   PATIENTS AND METHODS Between April 2002 and December 2006, 232 previously untreated patients with myeloma, age 75 years or older, were enrolled and 229 were randomly assigned to treatment. All patients received melphalan (0.2 mg/kg/d) plus prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) for 12 courses (day 1 to 4) every 6 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg/d of oral thalidomide (n = 113) or placebo (n = 116), continuously for 72 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival.   RESULTS After a median follow-up of 47.5 months, overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide compared with those who received melphalan and prednisone plus placebo (median, 44.0 v 29.1 months; P = .028). Progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide group (median, 24.1 v 18.5 months; P = .001).

AIM To investigate the reasons for, and morbidity associated with, overlooked pacing indications.   DESIGN Prospective observational study in a UK regional pacing centre and its referring district hospitals.   METHODS Hospital records from referring and implanting centres were reviewed for 95 consecutive patients undergoing first pacemaker implant to determine symptoms, investigations and hospitalisations occurring after documentation of a pacing indication.   RESULTS Thirty-three of ninety-five patients (35%) had a pacing indication overlooked, which was Class I in 14 patients and Class IIa in 19. Reasons for not making a pacing referral in these patients included: failure to recognize the indication in 14, making adjustments to potentially culprit medication in 15 and requesting additional 'confirmatory' tests in 4. Twenty-six patients (79%) with missed indications experienced adverse events after documentation of an indication, and before receiving a pacemaker: 23 had ongoing symptoms (including one cardiac arrest), three received temporary pacing wires and 18 were hospitalized with symptoms related to cardiac rhythm. Twenty-seven patients (82%) had a total of 38 additional specialist investigations after documentation of a pacing indication.   CONCLUSION Documentation of an indication for pacing failed to trigger referral for permanent pacing in 35% of patients. This failure led to significant delays, morbidity and use of health service resource, which may have been avoided if timely recognition of the pacing indication had prompted referral. Failure to recognize pacing indications and reassessing symptoms and repeating investigation after changes to medication, often required for the management of associated tachyarrhythmias or other medical conditions, contribute to these delays, perhaps unnecessarily.", "1_year_count": 3, "label": 11}, {"paper_id": "285acfa9e705eb25e591aac312e99e9216d4d53c", "text": "Background:\u2002 To estimate the direct and indirect costs of severe asthma and the economic impact of its management to low\u2010income families in Salvador, Brazil.", "1_year_count": 7, "label": 49}, {"paper_id": "338298c1b26f7eca5ced45a1e54ca605a041e739", "text": "Process of improving the performance of a parallel and distributed system through a redistribution of load among the processors is called load balancing.

OBJECTIVE To determine how inner vs outer macular volumes relate to peripapillary RNFL thickness and visual function in multiple sclerosis (MS) and to examine how these patterns differ among eyes with vs without a history of acute optic neuritis (ON).   DESIGN Study using cross-sectional optical coherence tomography.   SETTING Three academic tertiary care MS centers.   PARTICIPANTS Patients with MS, diagnosed by standard criteria, and disease-free control participants.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Optical coherence tomography was used to measure macular volumes and RNFL thickness. Visual function was assessed using low-contrast letter acuity and high-contrast visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts).   RESULTS Among eyes of patients with MS (n = 1058 eyes of 530 patients), reduced macular volumes were associated with peripapillary RNFL thinning; 10-microm differences in RNFL thickness (9.6% of thickness in control participants without disease) corresponded to 0.20-mm(3) reductions in total macular volume (2.9% of volume in control participants without disease, P < .001). This relation was similar for eyes of MS patients with and without a history of ON. Although peripapillary RNFL thinning was more strongly associated with decrements in outer compared with inner macular volumes, correlations with inner macular volume were significant (r = 0.58, P < .001) and of slightly greater magnitude for eyes of MS patients with a history of ON vs eyes of MS patients without a history of ON (r = 0.61 vs r = 0.50). Lower (worse) visual function scores were associated with reduced total, inner, and outer macular volumes. However, accounting for peripapillary RNFL thickness, the relation between vision and inner macular volume remained significant and unchanged in magnitude, suggesting that this region contains retinal structures separate from RNFL axons that are important to vision.   CONCLUSIONS Analogous to studies of gray matter in MS, these data provide evidence that reductions of volume in the macula (approximately 34% neuronal cells by average thickness) accompany RNFL axonal loss. Peripapillary RNFL thinning and inner macular volume loss are less strongly linked in eyes of MS patients without a history of ON than in eyes of MS patients with a history of ON, suggesting alternative mechanisms for neuronal cell loss.

For each topic's displaying region, we summarize the information contained in the search results under the corresponding topic so that only key messages will be displayed.

To date, little empirical data exist to characterise the nature of men\u2019s sexual risk as it relates to both their violence perpetration, and STI/HIV infection. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional survey of men ages 18\u201335 recruited from three community-based health clinics in an urban metropolitan area of the northeastern US (n\u200a=\u200a1585) were analysed to estimate the prevalence of IPV perpetration and associations of such violent behaviour with both standard (eg, anal sex, injection drug use) and gendered (eg, coercive condom practices, sexual infidelity, transactional sex with a female partner) forms of sexual-risk behaviour, and self-reported STI/HIV diagnosis. Results: Approximately one-third of participants (32.7%) reported perpetrating physical or sexual violence against a female intimate partner in their lifetime; one in eight (12.4%) participants self-reported a history of STI/HIV diagnosis. Men\u2019s IPV perpetration was associated with both standard and gendered STI/HIV risk behaviours, and to STI/HIV diagnosis (OR 4.85, 95% CI 3.54 to 6.66). The association of men\u2019s IPV perpetration with STI/HIV diagnosis was partially attenuated (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.55, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.67) in the multivariate model, and a subset of gendered sexual-risk behaviours were found to be independently associated with STI/HIV diagnosis\u2014for example, coercive condom practices (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.69), sexual infidelity (AOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.65 to 3.68), and transactional sex with a female partner (AOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.04). Conclusions: Men\u2019s perpetration of physical and sexual violence against intimate partners is common among this population. Abusive men are at increased risk for STI/HIV, with gendered forms of sexual-risk behaviour partially responsible for this association. Thus, such men likely pose an elevated infection risk to their female partners.

We conducted a systematic retrospective study examining which thresholds of dome-to-neck ratio, maximum neck width, and aspect ratio of intracranial aneurysms best predict the need for adjunctive techniques in endovascular management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-five consecutive patients who were selected for attempted embolization of 185 intracranial aneurysms were included in this study. Aneurysm dome-to-neck ratio (maximum dome width/maximum neck width), maximum neck width, and aspect ratio (dome height/maximum neck width) were measured on 2D digital subtraction angiography. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine which thresholds of dome-to-neck ratio, maximum neck width, and aspect ratio were most predictive of the need for adjunctive devices in endovascular management of these aneurysms. RESULTS: We demonstrated that 75% of aneurysms with dome-to-neck ratios >1.6 (P < .0001), 75% of aneurysms with aspect ratios >1.6 (P < .0001), and 70% of aneurysms with neck diameters <4.0 mm (P < .0001) did not need adjunctive techniques in their management. Adjunctive techniques were essential to treatment of 80% of aneurysms with dome-to-neck ratios <1.2 (P = .02) and 89% of aneurysms with aspect ratios <1.2 (P < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that aspect ratio was the best predictor of the need for an adjunctive device (P = .0004). CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysms with aspect and dome-to-neck ratios >1.6 usually did not require adjunctive techniques.

In this study, we sought to determine the relation of genetic polymorphisms of CYP genes to clopidogrel resistance in Koreans. Four hundred fifty patients who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents were randomly assigned to treatment with dual antiplatelet regimen (aspirin plus clopidogrel) or triple antiplatelet regimen (aspirin plus clopidogrel plus cilostazol).

In the clopidogrel-responsive group, there was a significantly higher proportion of cilostazol use. Because cilostazol showed a significant influence on clopidogrel resistance, we examined the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and clopidogrel resistance in the dual and triple antiplatelet therapy groups, respectively. In all subjects, the CYP2C19*3A allele was significantly more prevalent in the clopidogrel-resistant group compared with the clopidogrel-responsive group.

Advances in HIV treatment availability mean that the promise of highly active anti-retroviral treatment to turn HIV into a manageable chronic illness is becoming a reality for millions. However the mutability of the virus means that treatment adherence demands are high, and the supply of these life-saving treatments needs to be constant. The onus is generally placed on the individual to adhere, and there is little focus in research or policy on the state's adherence to delivering treatment consistently. Methods.We undertook in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the narratives of HIV treatment experience among 41 people living with HIV (PLHIV) infection and 18 HIV treatment service providers in Serbia and Montenegro, a transitional setting in which state delivered and funded HIV treatment is inconsistently available. Data were analysed inductively and thematically. Findings. Treatment shortages were common so the delivery of appropriate HIV treatment was not continuous. Access to reliable treatment and supply forecast information was weak and uneven. The insecure treatment situation fostered significant anxiety amongst PLHIV. Interpretation. In the absence of reliable and sustained treatment access, information and support, PLHIV absorb the anxieties of system failures. This uncertainty led to an individuation of \u201ctreatment\u201d.

BACKGROUND An intravascular NIRS system for detection of lipid core-containing plaques (LCP) has been validated in human coronary autopsy specimens. The SPECTACL (SPECTroscopic Assessment of Coronary Lipid) trial was a parallel first-in-human multicenter study designed to demonstrate the applicability of the LCP detection algorithm in living patients.   METHODS Intracoronary NIRS was performed in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Acquired spectra were blindly compared with autopsy NIRS signals with multivariate statistics. To meet the end point of spectral similarity, at least two-thirds of the scans were required to have >80% of spectra similar to the autopsy spectra.   RESULTS A total of 106 patients were enrolled; there were no serious adverse events attributed to NIRS. Spectroscopic data could not be obtained in 17 (16%) patients due to technical limitations, leaving 89 patients for analysis. Spectra from 30 patients were unblinded to test the calibration of the LCP detection algorithm. Of the remaining 59 blinded cases, after excluding 11 due to inadequate data, spectral similarity was demonstrated in 40 of 48 spectrally adequate scans (83% success rate, 95% confidence interval: 70% to 93%, median spectral similarity/pullback: 96%, interquartile range 10%). The LCP was detected in 58% of 60 spectrally similar scans from both cohorts.   CONCLUSIONS This intravascular NIRS system safely obtained spectral data in patients that were similar to those from autopsy specimens.

Twenty-six patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy completed a two-day, randomized, double blind crossover trial comparing the effects of D-Ribose and placebo on regional wall motion.

Patients were eligible for inclusion if presenting with disabling claudication, rest pain or tissue loss. Follow-up was performed and included clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography at all scheduled intervals. All patients were treated with warfarin. The main end-point of this study was primary patency of the bypass graft at 2, 5 and 10 years after implantation. Secondary end-points were mortality, primary assisted patency and secondary patency. Cumulative patency rates were calculated with life-table analysis and with log-rank test.   RESULTS After 5 years, the primary, primary assisted and secondary patency rates were 36% (confidence interval (CI): 26-46%), 46% (CI: 36-56%) and 51% (CI: 41-61%) for ePTFE and 52% (CI: 42-62%) (p=0.04), 66% (CI: 56-76%) (p=0.01) and 70% (CI: 60-80%) (p=0.01) for Dacron, respectively.

These factors were related to the physicians' own alcohol consumption.   METHODS A slightly adjusted version of the WHO Collaborative Study Questionnaire for General Practitioners was posted to all PCPs (n = 132) in the district of Skaraborg, Sweden, of whom 68 PCPs responded. In the questionnaire, the PCPs' perceptions of two patient vignettes were analysed.   RESULTS Both the gender of the patients in the vignettes and of the PCPs influenced the advice and the referrals that the patients received: 83% of male excessive drinkers and 47% of female excessive drinkers were recommended to cut down on drinking. In 50% of cases, the male excessive drinker was not referred, compared with 25% for the female excessive drinker. This was statistically significant only for excessive drinkers. The odds ratio for referral to any treatment was 0.33 (CI = 0.12-0.93) for the male excessive drinker compared with the female excessive drinker. The male PCP referred the excessive drinker less often to any treatment than did the female PCP, odds ratio 0.26 (CI = 0.08-0.90). The upper limit of alcohol consumption before the PCPs would advise the patient to cut down was significantly higher for PCPs with the AUDIT-C score >or= 3. The limit was 146 g/week for male patients and 103 g/week for female patients. Corresponding figures for PCP with the AUDIT-C score <or= 2 were 89 and 68 g/week.   CONCLUSION Male patients were less likely to be advised to stop drinking altogether than female patients and were less likely to be referred, according to this vignette study. Taking into account that male patients have a higher prevalence of alcohol problems, this may be of considerable importance for men's health outcomes. Implications of these findings are the need to increase awareness of male excessive drinking and that gendered perceptions might bias alcohol management recommendations.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 15}, {"paper_id": "a4578705d1c064e59172aedf47117a45643bfeb5", "text": "The reduction of intentional exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an important area of skin cancer prevention.

METHODS A computer simulation model of diabetes was used to project complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs over a 35-year time horizon. Cohort characteristics and treatment effect data were derived from a 26-week randomized clinical trial comparing exenatide and insulin glargine. Modeled treatment effects included reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by -0.99% and -1.07% and in body mass index (BMI) by -0.80 and +0.55 kg/m2 with exenatide and insulin glargine respectively. Changes in systolic blood pressure and serum lipid levels were also captured. Simulations incorporated published quality of life utilities and Swiss costs from 2006. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of projected outcomes. Future clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 2.5% per annum.   RESULTS In the base-case analysis exenatide was associated with comparable life expectancy (11,549 years versus 11,468 years) and an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.43 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus insulin glargine over a 35-year time horizon. Exenatide was associated with a reduced cumulative incidence of most diabetes-related complications including an absolute reduction in myocardial infarction by 0.28%. Assuming an annual treatment cost of CHF 2,797.74 for exenatide, direct costs increased by CHF 8,378 per patient over the 35-year time horizon compared to insulin glargine. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CHF 19,450 per QALY gained for exenatide versus insulin glargine.   CONCLUSIONS Exenatide was associated with comparable life expectancy and an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy versus insulin glargine over a 35-year time horizon.

It has come a long way since the original two patients who Dr. Guyuron saw in his office after cosmetic endoscopic brow lifts 9 years ago touted their improvement in their migraine headache symptoms\u2014an unexpected and even surprising \u201cside effect\u201d from surgery. Those two patients led Dr. Guyuron and his colleagues to review their historical experience with cosmetic corrugator resection to see whether this had been the case all along and had just gone unnoticed. When they published their first report on the subject in 2000 using a retrospective questionnaire to show that nearly 80 percent of patients had improvement in their migraine symptoms as compared with their baseline preoperative status,1 who would have thought that the pathway would eventually lead to a prospective study involving sham surgery with a 1-year follow-up that demonstrates without doubt that surgery is a legitimate form of treatment for migraineurs? The robust study design requires special commendation. A sham surgery study design hopes to overcome the placebo effect seen in the literature dealing mostly with pharmacotherapy.2 As one might expect, sham surgery in human beings is not an easy study design for which to gain institutional review board approval at any institution, let alone voluntary participation by patients. That is obviously why there is a dearth of this type of study in the world literature on any surgical subject. Nevertheless, in the alternative treatment of migraine headaches, there actually now exist five of these sham studies: three on the use of acupuncture,3\u20135 one on the closure of patent foramen ovale,6 and now this addition on surgical decompression of peripheral trigger points. Dr. Guyuron and his team\u2019s pursuit of academic integrity and the highest level of evidence to support this hypothesis is to be applauded. As with any quality science, the results of this study raise some interesting questions and answer others. For instance, how can one explain that one of the 26 patients undergoing sham surgery actually had complete elimination of migraine headaches at 1 year? It has been this author\u2019s experience, and Dr. Guyuron\u2019s, that most if not all patients experience improvement immediately after surgery irrespective of the longer term result. This may be attributed to the surgical undermining of flaps, neurapraxias from nerve manipulation, or the placebo effect. However, for the beneficial effect to persist at 1 year is a surprising finding, and one that warrants further investigation. Conversely, eight of 49 patients who underwent actual surgery had no change in their migraine headache symptoms after surgery. Although the authors point out that this result may reflect the fact that only one trigger point was addressed, potentially leaving others untreated, the fact is that there exists a small subpopulation of nonresponders in all available clinical studies on this subject reported in the peer-reviewed literature.7\u201310 The implication, of course, is that there are more trigger points as yet undescribed, or even that perhaps the surgical technique for comprehensive decompression of these nerves requires further refinement.

Whereas high-protein (HP) diets have been found to be superior to high-carbohydrate (HC) diets for weight loss in the short term, their benefits long term are unclear, particularly for weight maintenance. Furthermore, the literature lacks consensus on the long-term effects of an HP diet on cardiovascular disease risk factors.   OBJECTIVE The objective was to investigate whether macronutrient dietary composition plays a role in weight maintenance and in improvement of cardiovascular disease risk factors.   DESIGN The study comprised 2 phases. Phase 1 featured a very-low-energy diet for 3 mo. In phase 2, the subjects were randomly assigned to an HP or an HC diet for 12 mo. The diets were isocaloric, tightly controlled, and individually prescribed for weight maintenance. The subjects were overweight or obese but otherwise healthy men and women.   RESULTS The subjects lost an average of 16.5 kg during phase 1 and maintained a mean (+/-SEM) weight loss of 14.5 +/- 1.2 kg (P < 0.001) during phase 2; no significant differences between groups were observed.

The aim of the study was to define and evaluate a simple clinical algorithm for rapid initial identification of patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis who do not require intensive care.   METHODS This prospective study included 394 patients who were admitted to the Municipal Clinic of L\u00fcneburg, Germany, between 1987 and 2003. From a number of parameters of disease severity on admission, 3 parameters that showed the strongest prediction of a nonsevere course (no rebound tenderness and/or guarding, normal hematocrit level, and normal serum creatinine level) were combined to form the harmless acute pancreatitis score (HAPS). The score then was validated in a German multicenter study including 452 patients between 2004 and 2006.   RESULTS In both the initial and the validation set, the HAPS correlated with a nonsevere course of the disease (P < .0001). The score correctly identified a harmless course in 200 (98%) of 204 patients.   CONCLUSIONS The HAPS enables identification, within approximately 30 minutes after admission, of patients with acute pancreatitis whose disease will run a mild course.

Toxicity was dominated by gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, subileus and gastric ulcer. One patient had thrombocytopenia grade 2. There were two cases each of grade 3\u20134 hyperuricemia and hypokalemia. Safety and efficacy of the NAD depleting drugs CHS 828 and FK866 have been reported from four phase I clinical trials, including a total of 97 patients with previously treated solid tumours. Outstanding toxicity reported was thrombocytopenia and various gastrointestinal symptoms. No objective tumour remission has been observed in the total of 104 patients treated in the above early trials.ConclusionsCritical toxicity from NAD depleting cancer drugs to consider in future trials seems to be thrombocytopenia and various gastrointestinal symptoms.

A trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety in patients with no active bleeding at endoscopy, receiving banding ligation association with terlipressin to prevent very early rebleeding. Methods: Patients with no active variceal bleeding at endoscopy were evaluated. Eligible patients were randomised to receive terlipressin infusion alone for 5 days (Terlipressin group) or banding ligation plus terlipressin infusion for 2 days (Combined group). Primary endpoints were treatment failure and very early rebleeding. Results: The terlipressin group was composed of 46 patients and the Combined group was composed of 47 patients. Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline data. Forty-eight-hour haemostasis was achieved in 91% in the Terlipressin group and 98% in the Combined group (p\u200a=\u200a0.20).

Baseline clinical and laboratory data were obtained on all patients. Plaque area was determined every 6 mo using bilateral carotid ultrasonography. Plaque area distribution was normalized using a cube root transformation.

Clinical and biologic markers were evaluated for their impacts on outcome.   PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred nine patients were enrolled, and 103 received at least one dose of alemtuzumab. After dose escalation, alemtuzumab was administered subcutaneously at 30 mg three times weekly for up to 12 weeks. Response was assessed every 4 weeks during treatment and quarterly thereafter.   RESULTS The overall response rate was 34% (complete response, 4%; partial response, 30%). The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 19.1 months. Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 56%, 57%, and 49% of patients, respectively. Grades 3 to 4 noncytomegalovirus and cytomegalovirus infections occurred in 29% and 8% of patients, respectively. Injection-site skin reactions were generally mild. Efficacy did not vary significantly in subgroups defined by genetic parameters (in particular, in 17p deletion, 11q deletion, mutated TP53, and unmutated VH), but efficacy was inferior in patients with increased beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) and thymidine kinase (TK). In multivariate analysis of clinical and biologic variables, age, performance status, beta2-MG, and TK were independent prognostic factors for OS.   CONCLUSION Subcutaneous alemtuzumab appears as effective and safe as intravenous alemtuzumab in fludarabine-refractory CLL.

Results: The intervention group consumed more energy (difference 194 kcal/day; p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and protein (difference 11.8 g/day; p<0.001) than controls. The intervention group gained weight during the intervention period and maintained weight during follow-up; the controls lost weight throughout the study.

Ablation reduces ICD interventions in patients with ablatable arrhythmia, but its effectiveness needs to be proven for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) regardless of the type of arrhythmia. Our study was designed to address this issue, but it had to be terminated due to recruitment problems. The reasons for early termination are described in this paper.   METHODS Patients with CAD and implanted ICD, who within the past three months survived an episode of VT/VF, were selected for this study. Patients were to be randomised for ablation or pharmacotherapy. A group of 209 patients was screened between June and December of 2007.   RESULTS Out of 209 patients, 39 (18.7%) had appropriate ICD therapy during the last three months and were potentially eligible for the trial. Out of 39 patients, 34 could not be randomised, due to the presence of exclusion criteria (n-25) or consent refusal (n-9). Previous ablation (n-10), left ventricular thrombus (n-3) or presence of mitral or aortic artificial valve (n-3) were the most frequent exclusion criteria. During follow-up of 12 months one patient required ablation due to frequent ICD discharges. From the five randomised patients, two were randomised to ablation and three to the pharmacotherapy arm.   CONCLUSIONS 1. Ablation might not be suitable as a routine treatment for all patients with ICD interventions, as a significant group prefers not to undergo RF ablation as a routine treatment or there are contraindications for the ablation. 2. There are obstacles in prospective and randomised evaluation of the role of ablation in patients with CAD and ICD interventions, which are related both to patients' medical conditions and to patients' will.

BACKGROUND The recommended regimen for eptifibatide is a double bolus followed by an infusion for 18 h. It is not known whether the infusion can be shortened if the PCI is uncomplicated.   METHODS We enrolled 624 patients with stable angina, acute coronary syndrome, or recent ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (>48 h) who underwent successful coronary stenting and received eptifibatide. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an 18-h infusion or an abbreviated infusion of <2 h. The primary end point was the incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis defined as troponin-I elevation >0.26 microg/l. Secondary end points included death, myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularization at 30 days, and in-hospital major bleeding using the REPLACE-2 (Randomized Evaluation in PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events) trial criteria.   RESULTS The incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis was 30.1% in the <2-h group versus 28.3% in the 18-h group (mean difference: 1.8%; upper bound of 95% confidence interval: 7.8%; p < 0.012 for noninferiority). The 30-day incidence of myocardial infarction, death, and target vessel revascularization was similar in both groups (p = NS). Major bleeding was less frequent in the <2-h group (1.0% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.02).   CONCLUSIONS After uncomplicated PCI, eptifibatide infusion can be abbreviated safely to <2 h. It is not inferior to the standard 18-h infusion in preventing ischemic outcome, and it may be associated with less major bleeding.

The present study addresses the question of whether indices of serotoninergic dysfunction, as investigated by a neuroendrocine challenge paradigm, are related to pain sensitivity. Nineteen drug-free inpatients with unipolar major depression underwent a neuroendocrine challenge test by measuring cortisol and prolactin in response to intravenously administered clomipramine (12.5mg). Heat/cold pain thresholds, warmth/cold detection thresholds, measures of current pain complaints and mood were assessed the day before and three day after challenge procedure. When patients were classified in subgroups based on a median split of their cortisol response values, the low-responsive group showed significantly elevated heat pain thresholds and nearly significantly elevated cold pain thresholds compared to the high-responsive group. No such group differences were found with regard to somatosensory thresholds, measures of pain complaints and mood.

Their medical histories often include different treatments without attention to work-relatedness or communication with occupational health providers, leaving them passive and medicalized in (outpatient) health care.

It aims at function restore (instead of pain elimination), return to work (RTW) and coordinated communication.   OBJECTIVES To qualitatively explore how patients and health care providers perceive the programme effectiveness and which factors influence its implementation.   METHODS In-depth, semi structured interview with patients and focus groups of health care providers are used, all recorded, transformed into verbatim transcript and analysed.   RESULTS This qualitative study shows that although patients' expectations were low at the start of the program, and despite long LBP histories, including many different therapies, (primarily) directed at pain reduction, the MOC programme was successful in changing patients' goal setting from pain oriented towards function restore and RTW. The programme was therefore perceived as applicable and effective. Patient compliance was influenced by barriers - despair, supervisory and subordinate resistance at work, waiting period, medicalisation in health care - and facilitators: disciplinary motivation, protocolled communication, information supply, tailor-made exercises. For some patients the barriers were too high. Several improvement suggestions were given.

The aim of this study was to investigate short-term effects of a high intensity contraction on productivity, RPE and upper trapezius activity and rest during computer work and a subsequent pause from computer work.Methods18 female computer workers performed 2 sessions of 15 min standardized computer mouse work preceded by 1 min pause with and without prior high intensity contraction of shoulder elevation. RPE was reported, productivity (drawings per min) measured, and bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) recorded from the dominant upper trapezius during pauses and sessions of computer work.

The lack of an adequate support for monitoring the evolution of physical variables prevents the suitable exploitation of the information obtained when monitoring critical patients. This work proposes a solution for designing intelligent alarms capable of addressing the flaws and limitations of threshold alarms.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The solution proposed is based on the multivariable fuzzy temporal profile (MFTP) model, a formal model for describing certain monitoring criteria as a set of morphologies defined over the temporal evolution of the patient's physiological variables, and a set of relations between them. The MFTP model represents these morphologies through a network of fuzzy constraints between a set of points in the evolution of the variables which the physician considers especially relevant. We also provide a knowledge acquisition tool, TRACE, with which clinical staff can design and edit alarms based on the MFTP model.   RESULTS Sixteen alarms were designed using the MFTP model; these were capable of supervising monitoring criteria that could be satisfactorily supervised with commercial monitoring devices. The alarms were validated over a total of 196h of recordings of physiological variables from 78 different patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Of the 912 alarm triggerings, only 7% were false positives. A study of the usability of the tool TRACE was also carried out. After a brief training seminar, five physicians and four nurses designed a number of alarms with this tool. They were then asked to fill in the standard System Usability Scale test. The average score was 68.2.   CONCLUSION The proposal presented herein for describing monitoring criteria, comprising the MFTP model and TRACE, permits the supervision of monitoring criteria that cannot be represented by means of thresholds, and makes it possible to construct alarms that give a rate of false positives far below that for threshold alarms.", "1_year_count": 3, "label": 41}, {"paper_id": "ee84a53b70d6a15012a2f35ff061ca87850e3bfe", "text": "The implementation of cigarette smoking abstinence reinforcement programs may be hindered by the time intensive burden placed on patients and treatment providers.

Sixty-eight smokers were enrolled to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based smoking cessation program. During the 6-week intervention period, all participants were asked to record 2 videos of breath carbon monoxide (CO) samples daily.

The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity, defined as any Grade 4-5 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity directly attributable to protocol treatment, requiring hospitalization and/or radiotherapy interruption. The secondary endpoints included feasibility, non-dose-limiting toxicity, and treatment response.   RESULTS A total of 27 patients were enrolled, 23 of whom had high-grade glioma (10 recurrent and 13 newly diagnosed). No dose-limiting toxicities were noted in any dose group, including the highest (1.3 mg/m(2)/dose). The most frequent toxicities were Grade 1 and 2 stomatitis, erythema, and alopecia.

Slow-Mohs surgery in 14 patients with periocular melanoma from 2000 to 2006. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent 14 Slow-Mohs procedures for eight lentigo maligna, one nodular, and one superficial spreading melanoma, and four lentigo maligna, 12 primary, and two recurrent tumors. The most common site was the lower eyelid (8/14, 57.1%). Breslow thickness ranged from 0.27 to 1.70 mm, with four cases less than 0.76 mm and one case greater than 1.5 mm. Five cases were a Clark level II or greater. Complete excision was achieved with one level (6 cases) or two or three levels (8 cases), with 2- to 3-mm margins at each level in all but one case.

To get an efficient quantitative analysis process, we developed a fully automatic three\u2010dimensional (3D) lumen contour detection method and evaluated the results against those derived by expert human observers. Methods: The method was developed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). It incorporates a graphical user interface for contour display and, in the selected cases where this might be necessary, editing. OCT image data of 20 randomly selected patients, acquired with a commercially available system (Lightlab imaging, Westford, MA), were pulled from our OCT database for validation. Results: A total of 4,137 OCT images were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in mean lumen areas between the two methods (5.03 \u00b1 2.16 vs. 5.02 \u00b1 2.21 mm2; P = 0.6, human vs. automated). Regression analysis showed a good correlation with an r value of 0.99. The method requires an average 2\u20135 sec calculation time per OCT image. In 3% of the detected contours an observer correction was necessary. Conclusion: Fully automatic lumen contour detection in OCT images is feasible with only a select few contours showing an artifact (3%) that can be easily corrected.

To date, no intervention trials have examined the possible beneficial effects of fish intake on colorectal cancer risk. Objective: The objective was to investigate the effects of a 6-mo intervention with oil-rich or lean fish on apoptosis and mitosis within the colonic crypt. Design: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled intervention trial, patients with colorectal polyps, inactive ulcerative colitis, or no macroscopic signs of disease were recruited (n = 242) and randomly allocated to receive dietary advice plus either 300 g oil-rich fish (salmon) per week (n = 82), 300 g lean fish (cod) per week (n = 78), or only dietary advice (DA) (n = 82). Apoptosis and mitosis were measured in colonic biopsy samples collected before and after intervention (n = 213). Results: The total number of apoptotic cells per crypt did not increase in the salmon or cod group: 20.10 (95% CI: 20.36, 0.16) and 20.06 (95% CI: 20.32, 0.20), respectively, compared with the DA group.

RESULTS Two hundred and eight PD patients (English speaking: 135) participated in the study. Spearman correlation coefficients between the EQ-5D and PDQ-8 ranged from 0.25 to 0.75 for English-speaking patients and from 0.16 to 0.67 for Chinese-speaking patients. By and large, the EQ-5D scores were weakly or moderately correlated with Hoehn and Yahr stage (correlation coefficients: 0.05 to 0.43), Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living score (correlation coefficients: 0.10 to 0.60), and duration of PD (correlation coefficients: 0.16 to 0.43). The EQ-5D index scores for patients with dyskinesia or \"wearing off\" periods were significantly lower than those without these problems. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) scores also differed for English-speaking patients with deferring dyskinesia, \"wearing off\" periods, or health transition status; however, such differences were not observed in patients who completed the survey in Chinese.   CONCLUSIONS The EQ-5D questionnaire appears valid for measuring quality of life in patients with PD in Singapore. However, the validity of EQ-VAS in Chinese-speaking patients with PD should be further assessed.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 37}, {"paper_id": "23ac95ba51e03091b0890f248bb6c8a1f08c031a", "text": "In 26 stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tidal expiratory flow-limitation (TEFL), inspiratory capacity, breathing pattern and dyspnea sensation were assessed during air and heliox (20% O(2) in He) breathing at rest and during exercise up to 2/3 maximal work rate.

Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 70 patients treated from 1990 to 2006 at our center. Clinical data including demographics, stage, surgery, chemotherapy, survival, menses status, and fertility were collected from patients\u2019 charts. Results:Median age was 22 years (range, 9\u201368). The histologic subtypes included 36 dysgerminomas, 11 yolk sac tumors, 3 immature teratomas, 1 embryonal carcinomas, and 19 mixed types. The most striking clinicopathologic finding was a history of concomitant immunosuppressant therapy, which was observed in 2 patients. Two patients had contralateral sex-cord tumors at presentation and follow-up. During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years, 11 patients had recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 8 months (6\u201328 months). Recurrences appeared in the abdominopelvic cavity in 9 out of 11 patients. Only one could be salvaged with second-line chemotherapy. Cumulative survival rate was 97% and 60% in patients with dysgerminoma and nondysgerminoma, respectively. Nondysgerminoma histology and residual tumor after surgery were unfavorable prognostic factors (P < 0.001 and P = 0.015). Fertility-sparing surgery was as effective as radical surgery among all eligible patients. Of patients with known menstrual status, 96% had regular menses. Of the 8 patients who opted for conception among these patients, 7 delivered healthy infants. Conclusions:Nondysgerminomas have an aggressive clinical course. New treatment strategies are needed for eradication of abdominopelvic disease at initial diagnosis and recurrent setting.

Adjuvant or neo-adjuvant hormonal treatments were not allowed. 250 mg gefitinib q.d. was started one week before and lasted for the duration of radiation therapy. 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/day) of 3D-CRT was administered to the tumor, prostate and seminal vesicles, followed by a 22 Gy booster (2 Gy/day) for a 72.4 Gy total dose. EGFR expression, presence of EGFRvIII and activated pEGFR were studied. Levels of serum TNF, IL-1 \u03b1 and IL-6 were also evaluated.   RESULTS Maximum tolerated dose was not reached in phase I (12 patients) and 30 additional patients were treated in phase II. Thirty (71.4%) patients completed trial medication and 12 (28.6%) prematurely discontinued because of adverse events.

After assessing demographics, severity of alcohol use, suicidality, impulsivity, depression, hopelessness, and severity of alcohol use at baseline, patients were followed for approximately 1 year to evaluate treatment outcomes. Genetic polymorphisms in several genes (TPH2, SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, COMT, and BDNF) were tested as predictors of relapse (defined as any drinking during follow-up) while controlling for baseline measures.

OBJECTIVES To compare efficacy of (1) 3-day treatments with FP to dexamethasone (DEX) for management of RAO; and (2) FP and DEX to no treatment in prevention of acute RAO exacerbations.   ANIMALS Nine RAO affected horses.   METHODS Crossover studies in RAO-affected horses compared (a) 3-day treatment of RAO exacerbation with FP (3 and 6 mg q12h) and DEX (0.1 mg/kg q24h) and (b) FP (6 mg q12h) and DEX (0.1 mg/kg q24h) to no treatment for prevention of acute exacerbations of RAO. Treatment efficacy and unwanted effects were judged from maximal change in pleural pressure (DeltaPpl(max)), serum cortisol (COR), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology, and subjective scores for respiratory distress and lameness.   RESULTS In treatment trial, DEX and FP (6 mg) significantly decreased DeltaPpl(max) by 48 and 72 hours, respectively; FP (3 mg) had no significant effect. DEX decreased COR more than did FP. In prevention trial, both DEX and FP (6 mg) prevented the increase in DeltaPpl(max) that occurred in untreated horses. Both treatments decreased COR to the same degree. FP and DEX had no effects on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology and there was no evidence of laminitis.

METHODS A randomized controlled trial was carried out on outpatients with type 2 diabetes from two hospitals who met the criteria and gave consent to participate. They were randomly divided into an intervention group that followed the program and a control group that followed usual clinical practise. The intervention group received <30 min of monthly interviews based on the program's textbook and biweekly telephone calls from a nurse educator throughout the 12 months.

Methods Two hundred NBI images [57 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN)/early cancer (EC)] were evaluated twice by four NBI-experienced and four nonexperienced endoscopists in the field of NBI. Endoscopists assessed each image for: quality, suspicion for dysplasia, and regularity of mucosal and vascular patterns. Observer agreement was assessed using \u03ba statistics. Results Overall interobserver agreement for the items evaluated was \u2018moderate\u2019 and varied between 0.42 and 0.44. Overall intraobserver agreement was \u2018moderate\u2019 to \u2018substantial\u2019 (\u03ba 0.60\u20130.62).

Four pairs of image sets were used: digitally reconstructed radiographs vs. on-board orthogonal paired radiographs for the 2D method, coronal-reference DTS vs. on-board coronal DTS for the coronal-DTS method, sagittal-reference DTS vs. on-board sagittal DTS for the sagittal-DTS method, and planning CT vs. CBCT for the CBCT method. The registration results were compared.   RESULTS The systematic errors in all methods were <1 mm/1 degrees . When registering the bony anatomy, the mean vector difference was 0.21 +/- 0.11 cm between 2D and CBCT, 0.11 +/- 0.08 cm between CBCT and coronal DTS, and 0.14 +/- 0.07 cm between CBCT and sagittal DTS. The correlation between CBCT to DTS was stronger (coefficient = 0.92-0.95) than the correlation between 2D and CBCT or DTS (coefficient = 0.81-0.83).

CONCLUSION DTS could provide equivalent results to CBCT when the bony anatomy is used as landmarks for prostate image-guided radiotherapy.

There are limited data on the incidence of lower GI complications in clinical practice and most studies that have been done have serious methodological limitations to inferring the actual burden of this problem. The aims of this study were to analyze time trends of hospitalizations resulting from GI complications originating both from the upper and lower GI tract in the general population, and to determine the risk factors, severity, and clinical impact of these GI events.METHODS:This was a population-based study of patients hospitalized because of GI complications in 10 general hospitals between 1996 and 2005 in Spain. We report the age- and gender-specific rates, estimate the regression coefficients of the upper and lower GI event trends, and evaluate the severity and associated risk factors. GI hospitalization charts were validated by an independent review of large random samples of unspecific and specific codes distributed among all hospitals and study years.RESULTS:Upper GI complications fell from 87/100,000 persons in 1996 to 47/100,000 persons in 2005, whereas lower GI complications increased from 20/100,000 to 33/100,000. Overall, mortality rates decreased, but the case fatality remained constant over time. Lower GI events had a higher mortality rate (8.8 vs. 5.5%), a longer hospitalization (11.6\u00b113.9 vs. 7.9\u00b18.8 days), and higher resource utilization than did upper GI events. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without concomitant proton pump inhibitor was more frequently recorded among upper GI complications than among lower GI complications. When comparing upper GI events with lower GI events, we found that male gender (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70\u20132.21), and recorded NSAID use (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.60\u20132.30) were associated to a greater extent with upper GI events, whereas older age (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77\u20130.89), number of comorbidities (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86\u20130.96), and having a diagnosis in recent years (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90\u20130.94) were all associated to a greater extent with lower GI events than with upper GI events after adjusting for age, sex, hospitalization, and discharge year.CONCLUSIONS:Over the past decade, there has been a progressive change in the overall picture of GI events leading to hospitalization, with a clear decreasing trend in upper GI events and a significant increase in lower GI events, causing the rates of these two GI complications to converge. Overall, mortality has also decreased, but the in-hospital case fatality of upper or lower GI complication events has remained constant.

METHODS Concentration data (omalizumab, free and total IgE) were obtained from 1781 patients aged 12-79 years, in four sparsely sampled randomized, placebo-controlled studies and 152 subjects in a richly sampled single-dose study.

Achieving these goals is dependant upon the precise localisation of PAs during surgery, particularly secreting microadenomas. However, some microadenomas are invisible on preoperative imaging and during surgery, leading some surgeons to perform total hypophysectomy in many patients to achieve cure at the expense of panhypopituitrism. We have examined optical detection systems to identify PAs intraoperatively. This paper reports our preliminary findings. Methods A prospective observational study design. Technique Patients were given 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) mixed in 30\u00a0ml of orange juice, orally 3\u00a0h before surgery. Surgery was performed in the supine position, under image guidance, through the right nostril using Storz 0 degree endoscope assisted with microsurgery as required. The endoscope was attached to photodiagnostic filters (PD) allowing switching the light from white to blue at the flick of a foot pedal. After the dura of the floor of the sella was incised a laser probe was inserted into the pituitary gland to identify the ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX spectroscopy at 632\u00a0nm, using an optical biopsy system (OBS). Once the adenoma was identified by the OBS it was exposed and examined by the PD system to detect fluorescence. The PA was removed and its type was confirmed by histopathology and correlated to the OBS and PD system findings. Patients Thirty consecutive patients were studied: 14 were non-functioning macroadenomas (NFA), 12 were secreting PAs and 4 pituitary cysts. The secreting PAs were GH (2), ACTH (3), prolactin (2) and gonadotrophins (5). Six were microadenomas (3 ACTH, 1 GH, 2 prolactin) and 20 were macroadenomas, of which 12 were invading macroadenomas. Twenty-four of these were examined by the OBS and the PD systems and six were examined by the PD system only. The true positive (sensitivity) of the PD and OBS systems were 80.8% (21/26) and 95.5% (21/22) respectively. The true negative (specificity) of PD and OBS were 75% (3/4) and 100% (2/2) respectively.

Virological responses were assessed by TaqMan (limit of detection 15 IU/mL) at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 (end of therapy), and 24 weeks following therapy (SVR). Undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA rates were significantly higher among patients receiving high\u2010dose induction therapy at week 4 (36% versus 26%, P < 0.005), week 8 (61% versus 50%, P < 0.005), and week 12 (74% versus 62%, P < 0.005). However, SVR was not significantly different between patients receiving high\u2010dose (53%) and standard (50%) therapy. Significant baseline prognostic factors for SVR included age, sex, race, histological stage, and viral load. SVR was considerably higher among patients with no or minimal fibrosis (64% and 60%, respectively) compared to those with severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (28% and 24%, respectively). The frequency of serious adverse events and drug discontinuations were similar in both groups, whereas PEG\u2010IFN dose modification, weight and appetite reduction, and grade IV neutropenia were significantly higher in the induction arm.

In this paper, we describe the epidemiological composition, and clinical as well as treatment characteristics of the KompNet cohort over time.MethodsThe KompNet cohort is an open, retrospective and prospective, multi-center, disease-specific and nationwide cohort study that started gathering data in June 2004. Semiannually, follow up visits of the patients are documented, covering a wide range of clinical and sociodemographic data. At enrolment and three years afterwards, an EDTA-sample is taken; a serum-sample is taken at every follow up.ResultsAs of 20.10.2008, a total of 15,541 patients were enrolled by 44 documenting sites. In September 2007, the cohort size was reduced to ten outpatient clinics and fifteen private practitioners, covering a total of 9,410 patients. The documentation of these patients comprised 24,117 years of follow up-time since enrolment (mean: 2.6 years), 62,862 person years inclusive data documented retrospectively on course of HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART, mean: 6.7 years). Due to the short period of recruitment till now, rates of death (0.3%-0.8%) and losses to follow up (1.1%-5.5%) were low.84.9% of patients were men. Main risk of transmission was sex between men (MSM: 62.9%). Mean age was 45 years. About two third of patients were classified as CDC-stage B or C.

The great majority of studies conducted upon it are single-center studies, and have reported results based upon a highly selected patient population. Our aim was to determine its diagnostic accuracy among an unselected population in multicenter studies.   METHODS Fifty-two patients were included in a non-randomised, retrospective study. Patients underwent multidetector computed tomography coronarography (16, 40 and 64 slices), in ten different centers (community hospitals or private centres), for clinical suspicion of coronary stenoses. The diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant coronary stenoses (> or =50%) was determined in comparison with conventional coronarography.   RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy were 91.4%, 17.7%, 69.6%, 50.0%, and 67.3%, respectively, in a patient-based analysis, and 55.3%, 85.6%, 30.3%, 94.4% and 82.5% in a segment-based analysis.   CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that routine implementation of multidetector computed tomography coronarography is limited by a high false-positive rate, when performed among an unselected population of patients with a high pretest probability of having coronary stenoses, in centres with variable expertises.

Such a pooling of data could yield the increased statistical power needed to elucidate effects that may not be seen with smaller samples. VBM analyses were performed to evaluate the consistency of patient versus control gray matter concentration (GMC) differences across the study sites, as well as the effects of combining multisite data.

While several factors, including time taken to access hospital care, contribute to this risk, it is also partially attributable to the lower uptake of evidence-based guidelines for the administration of thrombolytic drugs in rural emergency departments where up to one-third of eligible patients do not receive this life-saving intervention. Clinical pathways have the potential to link evidence to practice by integrating guidelines into local systems, but their impact has been hampered by variable implementation strategies and sub-optimal research designs. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a five-step clinical pathways implementation process on the timely and efficient administration of thrombolytic drugs for acute myocardial infarctions managed in rural Australian emergency departments.Methods/DesignThe design is a two-arm, cluster-randomised trial with rural hospital emergency departments that treat and do not routinely transfer acute myocardial infarction patients. Six rural hospitals in the state of Victoria will participate, with three in the intervention group and three in the control group. Intervention hospitals will participate in a five-step clinical pathway implementation process: engagement of clinicians, pathway development according to local resources and systems, reminders, education, and audit and feedback. Hospitals in the control group will each receive a hard copy of Australian national guidelines for chest pain and acute myocardial infarction management. Each group will include 90 cases to give a power of 80% at 5% significance level for the two primary outcome measures: proportion of those eligible for thrombolysis receiving the drug and time to delivery of thrombolytic drug.DiscussionImproved compliance with thrombolytic guidelines via clinical pathways will increase acute myocardial infarction survival rates in rural hospitals and thereby help to reduce rural-urban mortality inequalities.

The anti-obesity drug and cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, is associated with significant rates of depression and anxiety in clinical use.Materials and methodsThirty healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of rimonabant (20\u00a0mg) or lactose placebo in a double-blind, between-groups design. Three hours after medication administration, subjects undertook an emotional processing test battery including facial emotion recognition, emotional word attentional dot probe, self-relevant word classification, emotional and declarative memory and the emotion-potentiated acoustic startle response. Subjective state was assessed via self-report measures.ResultsA single dose of rimonabant did not alter subjective mood. However, rimonabant selectively reduced incidental recall of positive self-relevant adjectives, an effect contrary to that seen following the administration of antidepressants. There were no effects of rimonabant on the other measures of emotional processing.ConclusionsThese results suggest that a single dose of rimonabant decreases positive emotional memory in the absence of changes in subjective state.

Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to examine training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps and biceps activation during reaching tasks in stroke survivors with severe paresis in the chronic stage of recovery. The EMG data were obtained in the context of a single blind randomised clinical trial conducted with 42 stroke survivors with minimal upper limb muscle activity and who were more than 6\u00a0months post-stroke. Of the 33 participants who completed the study, 10 received training of reaching using a non-robotic upper limb training device, the SMART Arm, with EMG triggered functional electrical stimulation (EMG-stim), 13 received training of reaching using the SMART Arm alone, and 10 received no intervention. Each intervention group engaged in 12 1-h training sessions over a 4-week period. Clinical and laboratory measures of upper limb function were administered prior to training (0\u00a0weeks), at completion (4\u00a0weeks) and 2\u00a0months (12\u00a0weeks) after training.

Study findings demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in upper limb function for stroke participants in the two training groups compared to those who received no training however no difference was found between the two training groups. For the reaching tasks, all stroke participants, when compared to normal healthy adults, exhibited lower triceps and biceps activation and a lower ratio of triceps to biceps activation. Following training, stroke participants demonstrated increased triceps activation and an increased ratio of triceps to biceps activation for the task that was trained. Better performance was associated with greater triceps activation and a higher ratio of triceps to biceps activation. The findings suggest that increased activation of triceps as an agonist and an improved coordination between triceps and biceps could have mediated the observed changes in arm function.

Our goal was to evaluate an ELISA-based test for p16INK4a. Methods: 1,781 women undergoing routine screening provided cervical specimens for p16INK4a ELISA (original and enhanced versions of a prototype), liquid-based cytology, and Hybrid Capture II (hc2) testing. All women with a positive result and a random sample of those with negative results on all tests were referred for histologic diagnosis. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade \u22653 (\u2265CIN3) was the main outcome. The original analysis included all \u2265CIN3 outcomes (n = 28).

Different access routes have been proposed for TAVI including transapical, transsubclavian and transfemoral, with percutaneous transfemoral being the preferred because least invasive and nonsurgical. However, vascular access site complications due to the large-bore delivery catheters remain an important clinical issue, particularly with respect to the elderly patient collective typically considered for TAVI. In the study, the authors analyzed their 4-year TAVI experience with respect to vascular complications and their management in patients undergoing completely percutaneous transfemoral TAVI procedures.Patients and Methods:Since 2006, TAVI was performed in 101 consecutive patients at the West German Heart Center Essen. 33 patients underwent transapical TAVI, eight patients transfemoral TAVI with surgical access or closure, and 60 patients percutaneous transfemoral TAVI using two commercially available prosthetic valve devices.Results:Completely percutaneous TAVI was technically successful in all but one patient with malpositioning in the aortic arch during valve retrieval. There was no intraprocedural death and 30-day mortality was 12% (7/60). Vascular access site complications occurred in 19 patients (32%), necessitating surgical repair in six of them (10%). Complications included retroperitoneal hematoma (n = 2), iliac or femoral artery dissection (n = 10), (pseudo)aneurysm formation (n = 3), and closure device-induced vessel stenosis/ occlusion (n = 6). Of these, 13 cases could be managed either conservatively (n = 5) or by contralateral endovascular treatment (n = 8).Conclusion:Completely percutaneous TAVI has a high acute success rate with low intraprocedural and 30-day mortality. The patient collective appears to be prone to vascular complications which remain an important limitation of this novel technique. Although conservative or endovascular management is possible in the majority of cases, further technological developments are obliged to reduce the vascular complication rate.ZusammenfassungHintergrund und Fragestellung:Die katheterbasierte Aortenklappenimplantation ist eine neue, in der klinischen Routine bereits breit angewandte Therapieoption f\u00fcr Hochrisikopatienten mit kalzifizierter Aortenklappenstenose.

In this two-centre, prospective cohort study, we compared baseline characteristics and 30-day mortality between TAVI and SAVR in consecutive patients undergoing invasive treatment for aortic stenosis.   METHODS AND RESULTS We pre-specified different adjustment methods to examine the effect of TAVI as compared with SAVR on overall 30-day mortality: crude univariable logistic regression analysis, multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics, analysis adjusted for propensity scores, propensity score matched analysis, and weighted analysis using the inverse probability of treatment (IPT) as weights. A total of 1,122 patients were included in the study: 114 undergoing TAVI and 1,008 patients undergoing SAVR. The crude mortality rate was greater in the TAVI group (9.6% vs. 2.3%) yielding an odds ratio [OR] of 4.57 (95%-CI 2.17-9.65). Compared to patients undergoing SAVR, patients with TAVI were older, more likely to be in NYHA class III and IV, and had a considerably higher logistic EuroSCORE and more comorbid conditions. Adjusted OR depended on the method used to control for confounding and ranged from 0.60 (0.11-3.36) to 7.57 (0.91-63.0). We examined the distribution of propensity scores and found scores to overlap sufficiently only in a narrow range. In patients with sufficient overlap of propensity scores, adjusted OR ranged from 0.35 (0.04-2.72) to 3.17 (0.31 to 31.9).

INTERVENTION Patients were treated with RNU and lymphadenectomy.   MEASUREMENTS Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models addressed the association between the number of LNs removed and cause-specific mortality (CSM). The number of LNs removed was coded as a cubic spline to allow for nonlinear effects. Finally, the most informative cut-off for the number of removed LNs was identified.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS In the entire population, the number of LNs removed was not associated with CSM in univariable (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.99; p=0.16) or in multivariable (HR: 0.97; p=0.12) analyses.

Results Eighteen patients received 27 doses of Reolysin in 6 dose cohorts accomplishing a 300 fold dose escalation without a protocol-defined dose limiting toxicity. Drug related grade 2 toxicities included fatigue and fever (1 patient each). All patients developed neutralizing antibody during the course of the study. Viral shedding was observed in 6 patients. One patient with anthracycline and taxane refractory breast cancer experienced a partial response (PR) and her tumor had a ras G12A mutation. Biopsy from her chest wall mass showed evidence of necrosis and viral replication by electron microscopy. Overall clinical benefit (1 PR + 7 stable disease) rate was 45%, and appeared higher in patients with viral shedding (67%) than those without (33%).

Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention arm (n = 23), with in-hospital treatment of OSA using auto-adjusting positive airway pressure along with standard treatment of ADHF, or to the control arm (n = 23), in which they received only standard treatment for ADHF. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 3 nights postrandomization.   RESULTS The change in LVEF from baseline to 3 days postrandomization in the intervention arm was significantly superior to that of the control group. The difference in LVEF improvement was 4.6% (p = 0.03). LVEF increased in the intervention group by 4.5% (SE, 1.7%). The LVEF change in the control arm was--0.3% (SE, 1.5%). The difference in LVEF improvement between the two groups persisted after adjustment for baseline LVEF, type of cardiomyopathy, BMI, AHI, and sex.   CONCLUSIONS An approach of early identification and in-hospital treatment of OSA in patients with ADHF is feasible and resulted in improvement in systolic function. The impact of this approach on out-of-hospital outcomes requires further investigation.

The purpose of this study is to determine if patch angioplasty closure alters velocities just distal to CEA and to define the optimal velocities for detecting >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis.   METHODS This study includes 200 CEAs randomized into 100 with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) ACUSEAL patch and 100 with Hemashield Finesse patch. All patients underwent immediate postoperative duplex ultrasounds, which were repeated at 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the internal carotid artery ([ICA], just distal to the patch) of >or=130 c/s underwent computed tomography angiogram (CTA). PSVs, end diastolic velocities (EDV), and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery (ICA/CCA) ratios were correlated to completion arteriograms/CTAs. Receiver operator characteristic curves analyses were used to determine optimal velocity criteria in detecting >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis.   RESULTS One hundred ninety-five pairs of imagings (duplex ultrasound vs CTA/angiogram) were available for analysis. When standard velocity criteria for nonoperated arteries were applied, 37% and 10% of patients were believed to have >or=50% to <70% and >or=70% to 99% restenosis vs 11.3% and 11.3% on CTA/angiography, respectively (P < .001). The mean PSV for >or=30%, >or=50%, and >or=70% restenosis were 172, 249, and 389 c/s, respectively (P < .001).

Salivary cortisol levels, State Anxiety Inventory, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate data were collected pre and post the weekly sessions.   RESULTS All of the chosen measures except for three SF-36 scales recorded significant changes, however, despite the 4-week break (washout period), most outcome measures did not return to their pre-treatment baseline levels. This meant that the analysis of the data was complicated by significant effects involving ordering of treatment occurring for eight of the variables (one from SF-36, two from the GHQ, SAI, Salivary Cortisol, Systolic BP and HR).

BACKGROUND There is increasing interest in the absence of CAC as a \"negative\" cardiovascular risk factor. However, published event rates for individuals with no CAC vary, likely owing to differences in baseline risk, follow-up period, and outcome ascertainment. The prognostic significance of low CAC (CAC 1 to 10) is not well described.   METHODS Annualized all-cause mortality rates were assessed in 44,052 consecutive asymptomatic patients referred for CAC testing. Mean follow-up of the cohort was 5.6 +/- 2.6 years (range 1 to 13 years).   RESULTS A total of 19,898 patients (45%) had no CAC on screening electron beam tomography, whereas 5,388 (12%) had low levels of CAC (CAC 1 to 10), and 18,766 (43%) had CAC >10. There were 104 deaths in those with no CAC (0.52%), 58 deaths in those with CAC 1 to 10 (1.06%), and 739 deaths in those with CAC >10 (3.96%). Annualized all-cause mortality rates for CAC = 0, CAC 1 to 10, and CAC >10 were 0.87, 1.92, and 7.48 deaths/1,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality among CAC 1 to 10 versus CAC = 0 after adjustment for traditional risk factors was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44 to 2.75).

CONCLUSIONS In appropriately selected asymptomatic patients, the absence of CAC predicts excellent survival with 10-year event rates of approximately 1%. A finding of 0 CAC might be used as a rationale to emphasize lifestyle therapies rather than pharmacotherapy and to forgo repeated imaging studies.

Widespread cultivation of pearl shells has made pearls available for commercial use for a very reasonable price. The main chemical compound of pearls from shells Pinctada maxima is calcium-carbonate (CaCO3). Recently developed technologies applied in a micronisation process have provided increased gastrointestinal resorption of calcium, estimated at over 90% of calcium intake.   OBJECTIVE The paper is aimed at monitoring of efficacy and tolerance of six-month bio-calcium supplementation in postmenopausal women with reduced bone mineral density.   METHODS Group 1 (30 patients) received, three times a day, capsules of pearl powder from shells Pinctada maxima (it is equal to 260 mg of elementary calcium); group II (20 patients) received a daily dose of 500 mg inorganic CaCO3. Both groups received 666 IU of cholecalciferol per day. In all patients, bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine or hip, serum blood and urine levels of Ca, phosphates and alkaline phosphatase, were measured before and after six months of the treatment.   RESULTS Group I/Group II: average age 61.7/61.7 years; beginning of menopause: 48.32 /48 years; menopause duration 13.4/13.7 years; average body mass index 27.2/27 kg/m2. These two groups did not different significantly before supplementation. Six-month supplementation with CaCO3 of the biological origin led to the increase of BMD from 0.901 g/cm2 to 0.948 g/cm2 (p = 0.067), while BMD remained the same in the group supplemented with inorganic CaCO3 Gastrointestinal tolerability of bio-calcium was excellent, without any adverse events.   CONCLUSION These data could not strongly support the hypothesis of better efficacy of bio-calcium taking into account a small number of patients and a short follow-up period in this pilot study.

Daily life stress-sensitivity was modelled as the effect of ESM daily life stress appraisals on ESM NA.   RESULTS All three developmental stress exposures were moderated by genetic vulnerability, modelled as dizygotic (DZ) or monozygotic (MZ) co-twin depression status, in their effect on daily life stress-sensitivity. Effects were much stronger in participants with MZ co-twin depression and a little stronger in participants with DZ co-twin depression status, compared to those without co-twin depression. NLE main effects and NLE genetic moderation were reducible to birthweight and childhood adversity.   CONCLUSIONS The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adult daily life stress-sensitivity is the result of sensitization processes initiated by developmental stress exposures. Genes associated with depression may act by accelerating the process of stress-induced sensitization.", "1_year_count": 13, "label": 105}, {"paper_id": "e1bedecde88750e73a1ed60d67af9cec38eba0cc", "text": "OBJECTIVES Prior research has demonstrated that emergency department (ED) patient acceptance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening is partially dependent on patients' self-perceived risk of infection. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI)-based feedback. The intervention aimed to increase patient's self-perceived risk of being HIV infected by providing immediate feedback on their risk behaviors.   METHODS This 1-year, randomized, controlled trial at a U.S. ED enrolled a random sample of 18- to 64-year-old subcritically ill or injured adult patients who were not known to be HIV infected. All participants completed an anonymous, ACASI-based questionnaire about their HIV risk behaviors related to injection drug use and sex, as well as their self-perceived risk for being HIV infected. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: an intervention group in which participants received immediate ACASI-based feedback in response to each of their reported risk behaviors or a no-intervention group without feedback. Participants were asked to indicate their level of HIV risk on a five-point scale before and after they answered the questions. Change in level of self-perceived HIV risk was calculated and compared by study group using Pearson's chi-square test. An HIV risk behavior score that summarized reported HIV risk behavior was devised. Because HIV risk behaviors differ by sex, scores were calculated separately for each sex. Linear regression models that adjusted for study group and same subject covariance were employed to determine if higher HIV risk behavior scores were associated with an increase in self-perceived HIV risk.   RESULTS Of the 566 trial participants, the median age was 29 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 22-43 years), 62.2% were females, and 66.9% had been tested previously for HIV. After answering the reported HIV risk behavior questions, 12.6% of participants had an increase, 79.9% had no change, and 7.5% had a decrease in self-perceived HIV risk. Of the 46.6% of participants who initially indicated that they were not at risk for HIV, 11.4% had an increase in self-perceived HIV risk after answering the reported HIV risk behavior questions. Change in self-perceived HIV risk did not differ by study group (p = 0.77). There were no differences in reported HIV risk scores between the intervention and no-intervention groups for females (p = 0.78) or males (p = 0.86). In the linear regression models, a greater increase in self-perceived HIV risk was associated with higher reported HIV risk behavior scores for females (beta = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15, 1.04) but not for males (beta = 1.00, 95% CI = -0.13 to 2.14).   CONCLUSIONS Some ED patients can be moved, although modestly, to recognize their risk for being HIV infected by asking about their HIV risk behaviors. However, ACASI-based feedback messages about HIV risk behaviors do not increase subjects' self-perceived HIV risk. Female ED patients appear to increase their self-perceived HIV risk more than males when queried about their HIV risk behaviors.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 12}, {"paper_id": "1ca104ecfa75f422258a91d4c53971570c860e06", "text": "OBJECTIVE To assess whether providing customized clinical information to patients and physicians improves safety or quality of diabetes care.

METHODS This randomised, double-blind study was undertaken in 117 sites in North and South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. 379 patients with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more (>/=130 mm Hg if patient had diabetes or chronic kidney disease) who were receiving at least three blood-pressure-lowering drugs, including a diuretic, at full or maximum tolerated doses were randomly assigned to 14 weeks' treatment with placebo (n=132) or darusentan 50 mg (n=81), 100 mg (n=81), or 300 mg (n=85) taken once daily. Randomisation was made centrally via an automated telephone system, and patients and all investigators were masked to treatment assignments. The primary endpoints were changes in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00330369.   FINDINGS All randomly assigned participants were analysed. The mean reductions in clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 9/5 mm Hg (SD 14/8) with placebo, 17/10 mm Hg (15/9) with darusentan 50 mg, 18/10 mm Hg (16/9) with darusentan 100 mg, and 18/11 mm Hg (18/10) with darusentan 300 mg (p<0.0001 for all effects). The main adverse effects were related to fluid accumulation. Oedema or fluid retention occurred in 67 (27%) patients given darusentan compared with 19 (14%) given placebo. One patient in the placebo group died (sudden cardiac death), and five patients in the three darusentan dose groups combined had cardiac-related serious adverse events.

This analysis examined clinical and radiographic responses to methotrexate (MTX), etanercept (ETN), and combination ETN and MTX in patients with moderate versus severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in both early and late disease. Methods. Data from the Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate With Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO) and the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis trials were used. Patients were classified with moderate or severe RA based on Disease Activity Score including 28-joint count (DAS28). Outcomes included DAS28 remission, DAS28 low disease activity, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores, Total Sharp Score (TSS) progression, no radiographic progression (annualized change in TSS \u2264 0), change from baseline in TSS, and the change in TSS for patients who had radiographic progression (TSS > 0). Results. Patients with moderate disease generally achieved better clinical outcomes than patients with severe disease, including significant differences in DAS28 remission, low disease activity, and HAQ \u2264 0.5 at Month 12. Patients with baseline severe disease had higher ACR and DAS responses than patients with moderate disease. Conclusion. Patients with severe RA disease activity achieved substantial clinical improvement with high-dose MTX and/or ETN treatment, but patients with moderate disease were more likely to reach a lower disease activity state. These findings were independent of disease duration. The results support the opportunity for excellent clinical outcomes, particularly with combination therapy, in patients with moderate RA.

E-mail: edkeystone@mtsinai.on.ca Accepted for publication October 31, 2008. Achieving a low disease activity state or even remission is an important goal in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Disease duration, disease activity, and prior intensity of therapy are important considerations for optimizing the treatment of RA. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists and high-dose methotrexate (MTX) reduce synovitis and halt joint destruction in a majority of, but not all, treated patients, providing radiographic evidence of inhibition of disease progression in patients with both early and established RA1-3. As a consequence of a rapid onset of action, substantial reduction in signs and symptoms, and marked inhibition of radiographic progression, TNF antagonists have contributed to a new paradigm of therapy for RA. The efficacy of TNF antagonists has been demonstrated in clinical trials that have almost universally included patient populations mostly with severe RA. Although these patients have yielded important data, they represent only a subset of the entire RA population. Indeed, many patients seen in clinical practice do not have the level of severity seen in a typical clinical trial4. It is hypothesized that patients with more moderate disease activity will respond better to treatment than patients with severe disease activity. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data from a subanalysis of patients with moderate disease [defined by the Disease Activity Score including a Journal of Rheumatology The on February 17, 2015 Published by www.jrheum.org Downloaded from 523 Keystone, et al: Etanercept in RA 28-joint count (DAS28)] treated with adalimumab who achieved a better outcome than those who began with severe disease activity5. Further, in a pooled analysis of clinical trials, a correlation was observed between lower baseline disease activity (by the Simplified Disease Activity Index) and disease remission after 1 year of MTX and/or TNF antagonist treatment6. To investigate this concept, we carried out a post hoc analysis of a large dataset of patients from 2 clinical trials of etanercept (ETN). The objective of this analysis was to examine clinical and radiographic responses to MTX, ETN, and ETN and MTX combination therapy in patients with moderate versus severe RA in both early and late disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients. Data from the Trial of Etanercept and Methotrexate With Radiographic Patient Outcomes (TEMPO)3 and the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERA) trial7 were used for the analysis. The study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards and independent ethics committees at the participating study centers, and patients provided written informed consent. Methodology and study results from TEMPO and ERA have been published3,7. Briefly, the TEMPO study included 682 patients with active RA not adequately responding to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy other than MTX (43% had previous MTX use), with mean disease duration of about 6.6 years (patient eligibility requirement range, 6 months to 20 years)3. Patients were randomized to receive MTX monotherapy, ETN monotherapy 25 mg twice weekly, or concomitant MTX and ETN 25 mg twice weekly treatment for 12 months. The ERA study included 632 patients who had had RA for not more than 3 years and had not previously been treated with MTX. Patients received MTX or ETN (10 mg or 25 mg twice weekly) for 12 months7, although the 10-mg ETN group was not included in this analysis. Radiographic data were available at 6 and 12 months in both studies. Within each treatment group, patients with moderate disease activity at baseline were compared with patients with severe disease activity using the DAS28 as the measure for distinguishing moderate RA and severe RA. [DAS28 = 0.56*square root (tender28) + 0.28*square root (swollen28) + 0.70*ln (ESR) + 0.014*general health (measured on a visual analog scale of 100 mm); in which ESR is erythrocyte sedimentation rate8.] The calculation of DAS28 for assignment into moderate or severe disease activity groups was post hoc and not prespecified in either the TEMPO or ERA study protocols. Moderate RA was defined as DAS28 between > 3.2 and \u2264 5.1, and severe RA as DAS28 > 5.19,10. Five TEMPO and 10 ERA patients with low disease activity (DAS28 \u2264 3.2) at baseline or missing baseline DAS28 were excluded from the analysis. Outcomes evaluated. This was a post hoc analysis of clinical and radiographic outcomes. Clinical outcomes included DAS28 remission and DAS28 low disease activity. Remission was defined as DAS28 < 2.611. Low disease activity was defined as a DAS28 score \u2264 3.2. Other clinical endpoints included the change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, and 70 scores. A number of radiographic outcomes were evaluated: mean annualized Total Sharp Score (TSS) progression, no radiographic progression defined as an annualized change in TSS \u2264 0, and change from baseline in TSS and change in TSS for patients who had radiographic progression (defined as an annualized change in TSS > 0) over a 6to 12-month period. Radiographic progression was evaluated by annualized rates. Radiographs were evaluated using the van der Heijde-modified Sharp method12. Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics were used to describe disease severity for the 3 different treatment groups by HAQ, Physician Global Assessment (PGA), Patient Global Assessment, patient pain assessment (0\u2013100), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ESR. A generalized linear model or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the moderate and severe groups on these measurements as well as radiographic outcomes. Logistic regressions and chi-square tests were used to examine the differences in categorical outcomes, such as DAS remission and DAS low disease activity, between baseline severity groups and between treatment groups, with interaction terms. Fisher exact tests were used instead of chi-square tests when the expected count in any frequency table cell was less than 5. Cumulative probability plots were used to illustrate radiographic progression in a continuous manner. The probability plots are useful because they are not subject to a prespecified cutoff point for defining \u201cno progression,\u201d and they enable observers to easily visualize all of the data in either the positive (annualized change in TSS > 0) or negative (annualized change in TSS \u2264 0) direction. Probability plots for the change from baseline in TSS at 1 year were created for the different treatment groups in the TEMPO and ERA studies. Within each probability plot, each dot represents an individual patient.

All patients were on intravenous L-carnitine (2.5\u00a0g per session for patients >30\u00a0kg and 1\u00a0g for those <30\u00a0kg) for 9\u00a0months. The EPO dose was adapted monthly to maintain a target hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11\u201313\u00a0g/dl. Prior to the initiation of L-carnitine supplementation, the EPO requirement was 1.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22 (range 0.37\u20131.75) \u03bcg/kg darbepoetin alpha. Free carnitine (FC) levels were measured before (40.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u00a0\u03bcmol/l), immediately after the 9-month L-carnitine supplementation period (378.5\u2009\u00b1\u200977.3\u00a0\u03bcmol/l), and 4 months after withdrawal of L-carnitine (95.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/l). After 9\u00a0months, the EPO dose was 0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10 \u03bcg/kg (p\u2009<\u20090.002). The Hb levels increased from 12.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.97 to 14.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54\u00a0g/dl (p\u2009<\u20090.05) within the first 2 months, and the EPO dose was then decreased in a stepwise manner. In conclusion, following intravenous carnitine supplementation, FC levels were higher and persisted longer than expected. This rise was associated with increased Hb levels and decreased EPO requirement.

All participants received an education and counseling session from their cystic fibrosis team and were then randomized to receive the decision aid or usual care. The decision aid is available online at http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/decaids.html.   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary end points measured were participants' knowledge, realistic expectations, and decisional conflict evaluated 3 weeks after randomization. Patients randomized to the decision aid had greater knowledge about their options (P < 0.0001) and had more realistic expectations about the benefits and risks of lung transplantation (P < 0.0001) compared with those randomized to usual care. The total decisional conflict score was significantly lower in the decision aid group 3 weeks postrandomization compared with the usual care group (11.6 vs. 20.4; P = 0.0007).

The objectives of the study are: (1) identification of predictors for asthma in preschool children at risk for asthma with the aim of cross-validating an earlier derived prediction rule; (2) compare the effects of different treatment strategies in preschool children.DesignIn this prospective cohort study one to five year old children at risk of developing asthma were selected from general practices.

We previously used gene expression array analysis to distinguish subsets of advanced cancers based on disease outcome. In the present study, we report on gene expression of early-stage cancers and validate our prognostic model for advanced-stage cancers. Experimental Design: Frozen specimens from 39 stage I/II, 42 stage III/IV, and 20 low malignant potential cancers were obtained from four different sites. A linear discriminant model was used to predict survival based upon array data. Results: We validated the late-stage survival model and show that three of the most differentially expressed genes continue to be predictive of outcome. Most early-stage cancers (38 of 39 invasive, 15 of 20 low malignant potential) were classified as long-term survivors (median probabilities 0.97 and 0.86). MAL, the most differentially expressed gene, was further validated at the protein level and found to be an independent predictor of poor survival in an unselected group of advanced serous cancers (P = 0.0004). Conclusions: These data suggest that serous ovarian cancers detected at an early stage generally have a favorable underlying biology similar to advanced-stage cases that are long-term survivors. Conversely, most late-stage ovarian cancers seem to have a more virulent biology.

Objective:To investigate relationships between carpal tunnel syndrome, functional status, subject demographics, physical examination findings, and median nerve conduction study findings in manual wheelchair users with paraplegia. Design:Multicenter cross-sectional study. One hundred twenty-six manual wheelchair-using individuals with chronic paraplegia answered self-administered questionnaires on demographics, symptoms, and functional status. They underwent physical examination specific for carpal tunnel syndrome and upper-limb nerve conduction studies. Results:Fifty-seven percent of subjects had symptoms (72.2% bilateral); hand numbness was most common. Sixty percent of subjects had carpal tunnel syndrome physical examination findings (59.2% bilateral). Those with physical examination findings were more likely to have longer duration of injury (P = 0.003). Seventy-eight percent of subjects had electrophysiologic evidence of median mononeuropathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 159 patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomized trial to determine if thalidomide can improve the efficacy of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in hormone responsive patients with an increasing prostate specific antigen after primary definitive therapy for prostate cancer. Patients were randomized to 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist followed by 200 mg per day oral thalidomide or placebo (oral phase A). At the time of prostate specific antigen progression gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was restarted for 6 additional months. Patients were then crossed over to the opposite drug and were treated until prostate specific antigen progression (oral phase B). Testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone were likewise monitored throughout the study.   RESULTS During oral phase A the median time to prostate specific antigen progression was 15 months for the thalidomide group compared to 9.6 months on placebo (p = 0.21). The median time to prostate specific antigen progression during oral phase B for the thalidomide group was 17.1 vs 6.6 months on placebo (p = 0.0002).

[1] on the comparison of short-term outcomes of the PFC rotating platform and the Medial Pivot total knee replacements. Osteoarthritis in the knee must differ considerably in its presentation in the Korean population from that encountered in western society where the need for bilateral total knee replacement at presentation remains the exception rather than the norm, and which may limit general applicability of the findings described by Kim et al. Also, the study population was manipulated as patients with rheumatoid arthritis were excluded; in my view, this subgroup would obtain less favorable results from rotating platforms.    However, numerous errors make interpretation of the data difficult. The authors state they treated 98 patients (198 knees) with bilateral arthritis. Clearly one of these figures is wrong. The authors also state three patients were excluded because they had infection, but the number of patients continuing in the analysis was reduced only to 96. Also, four patients were lost to followup. If the starting number was 98 patients, with reported exclusions only 91 patients were studied, not 92 as stated.    Additional errors occurred in the presentation of the results. The mean preoperative ranges of movement for the two designs were 124\u00b0 each as displayed in Table\u00a02, but 124\u00b0 vs 123\u00b0 in the text. In Table\u00a03, 38 of 92 is 41%, not 63% as written, and 51 of 92 is 55%, not 34% as written. Table\u00a06 has curiously identified equal numbers of patients who received PFC knees, 37 (40%) in each of the available satisfaction ratings giving a total of 148 knees.    Given the limited period between February and April 2004 in which all these operations were performed, it would be helpful to receive confirmation that Dr. Kim did perform all the operations as reported. As the exclusion criteria for the study was infection, additional explanation is required why 12 infected knees (11 Medial Pivot, one PFC) remain in the analysis of the results particularly as dissatisfaction in one group seems to hinge on the patients\u2019 experience of infection. As the implants and instruments were not implicated as the source of the infections, it suggests that inexperience with the instrumentation might be relevant. I wonder if Kim et al. could describe their experience using the Medial Pivot replacement before commencing the trial. Furthermore, it would be relevant to know if this problem occurred more frequently in the second side than the first. Additionally, the antibiotic prophylaxis observed in these circumstances is highly relevant.    Although the surgical technique was said to be common for all patients, three separate ways of setting the rotation of the femoral jig were used. The knees were said to be subject to a balancing procedure before implantation of the components. However, in the case of the rotating platforms, \u201cAdditional time was spent doing more meticulous ligament balance [1] [sic]\u201d. One wonders whether meticulous ligament balancing was not performed for the Medial Pivot knee and why such a meticulous endeavor was not afforded to all total knee replacements. This suggests the surgical technique was quite different between the designs.    The use of two scoring systems to examine outcome is commonplace, but the Hospital for Special Surgery score was superseded by the AKSS to distinguish function that may depend on extraneous factors from the outcome for the knee. I believe it is pointless to use both scores in the same study because of the overlap in the questions and thresholds.    In the radiographic analysis I wonder if the authors are confident no bias was present as the implants are radiographically different. The kappa score for intraobserver error did not reach the high level one would have anticipated, and I note in the Discussion that the authors acknowledge they did not study interobserver error.    Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance but it is unlikely the scores were distributed normally; generally they are skewed. I should have thought that Wilcoxon\u2019s matched pairs signed rank test would have been more appropriate at a stated level of significance of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.    Patient dissatisfaction in the Medial Pivot design was skewed by the infected prostheses, and it is not difficult to believe that the presence of recurrent effusions in nine of these patients indicates that the infection actually persists, as might the residual flexion contracture in three knees. When dissatisfaction with the range of movement is considered, this sentiment is expressed by more patients with PFC knees than Medial Pivot knees but this point was not discussed. In the Discussion, the authors state \u201cWe attributed dissatisfaction with the Medial Pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis to a higher incidence of infection and insufficient ROM\u201d [1]. However, the patients\u2019 opinions regarding their range of movement recorded in Table\u00a06 does not concur with the authors\u2019 assertion.    I note a reply already has been published regarding the letter from Pritchett [3]. In the reply [2], Kim et al. confirm their belief that the poorer Medial Pivot results were related to surgical technique that seems to contradict their manuscript where it is implied the design is the problem.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 3}, {"paper_id": "da739a9fbe4cd0ebe2c9c1b878288d4330e0cd9c", "text": "Objective Optimal bone mass in early adulthood is achieved through appropriate diet and lifestyle, thereby protecting against osteoporosis and risk of bone fracture in later life.

BACKGROUND Patterns of lipid abnormalities among Asians and their relative impact on cardiovascular risk have not been well characterized.   METHODS In a case-control study, 65 centers in Asia recruited 5,731 cases of a first AMI and 6,459 control subjects. Plasma levels of lipids and apolipoproteins in the different Asian subgroups (South Asians, Chinese, Southeast Asians, and Japanese) were determined and correlated with the risk of AMI.   RESULTS Among both cases and controls, mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were about 10 mg/dl lower in Asians compared with non-Asians. A greater proportion of Asian cases and controls had LDL-C </=100 mg/dl (25.5% and 32.3% in Asians vs. 19.4% and 25.3% in non-Asians, respectively). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were slightly lower among Asians compared with non-Asians. There was a preponderance of people with low HDL-C among South Asians (South Asia vs. rest of Asia: cases 82.3% vs. 57.4%; controls 81% vs. 51.6%; p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). However, despite these differences in absolute levels, the risk of AMI associated with increases in LDL-C and decreases in HDL-C was similar for Asians and non-Asians. Among South Asians, changes in apolipoprotein (Apo)A1 predicted risk better than HDL-C. ApoB/ApoA1 showed the strongest association with the risk of AMI.   CONCLUSIONS The preserved association of LDL-C with risk of AMI among Asians, despite the lower baseline levels, suggests the need to rethink treatment thresholds and targets in this population.

METHODS Eligible subjects were 18-45 years old with at least two monthly focal seizures (with or without secondary generalization) documented by 8 weeks' follow-up. Classic form of KD treatment (90% fat) was planned for 12 weeks: daily seizure diaries were kept and measurements of the urinary ketones were recorded. Blood studies were done monthly and resting energy expenditure (REE), substrate utilization; body composition and quality of life (QOL) were measured before and after intervention.   RESULTS Nine patients were enrolled (average age 28+/-6 years; seven women). Only two subjects concluded the study per protocol due to an early drop-out. The average length of KD treatment was 8+/-4 weeks (two patients completed 12 weeks of KD; feelings of hunger and lack of efficacy resulted in withdrawal of the rest). The two patients who concluded the study had a more than 50% reduction in the frequency of the seizures. The others experienced no improvement. Adherence to the KD protocol (100%) was documented by constant ketonuria and increased fat utilization as indicated by the change in respiratory quotient (p<0.031). The KD increased the cholesterol levels (mainly LDL; p=0.0001).   CONCLUSIONS In our experience with relatively small adult population, adherence to KD is difficult. In patients who had compliance over 3 weeks (6/8), KD does not seem to have a significant effect.

An open-labeled prospective study was conducted to compare the treatment effects of alendronate and alfacalcidol on hip BMD and bone turnover in Japanese men with osteoporosis or osteopenia with clinical risk factors for fractures. Materials and Methods One hundred twelve men with osteoporosis or osteopenia with clinical risk factors for fractures (mean age: 71.4 years) were randomly divided into two groups of 56 patients each: the alendronate (5 mg daily) and alfacalcidol (1 \u00b5g daily) groups. The BMD of the total hip, urinary level of cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), and serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) were measured during the 12-month-treatment period. Results Forty-five patients in the alendronate group and 42 patients in the alfacalcidol group completed the trial. Alendronate increased BMD (+2.3% at 12 months) following reductions in the urinary level of NTX (-46.4% at 3 months) and serum level of BSAP (-34.1% at 12 months), while alfacalcidol sustained BMD (-1.9% at 12 months) as well as the urinary level of NTX (+13.2% at 3 months) and serum level of BSAP (+1.8% at 12 months).

MethodsTwenty-seven patients with stable CAD were randomly assigned to either 1000\u2009mg twice daily of ranolazine or to matching placebo for 6 weeks and then crossed over for an additional 6 weeks in a double-blind design. EDV was assessed using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. Markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation were also evaluated. ResultsAfter 6 weeks, treatment with ranolazine significantly increased the EDV RH-PAT index as compared with baseline (1.85\u00b10.42 vs. 2.08\u00b10.57, P\u2009=\u20090.037).

Increased ROCK activity has been implicated in causing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, it is not known whether statins, at doses used to lower cholesterol levels, inhibit ROCK activity in humans with atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it is not known whether lipophilic and hydrophilic statins differ in their ability to inhibit ROCK activity. Accordingly, we enrolled 30 men with stable atherosclerosis (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] > or =100 mg/dL) in a randomized, double-blind study comparing equivalent LDL-lowering doses of a hydrophilic statin (rosuvastatin 10 mg once a day) with a lipophilic statin (atorvastatin 40 mg once a day) for 28 days. We assessed the change in lipids, ROCK activity, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery before and after statin therapy. Both treatment groups exhibited comparable 30% to 32% and 42% to 45% reductions in total and LDL cholesterol, respectively. Only atorvastatin reduced triglycerides, and neither statin altered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whereas both statins inhibited ROCK activity (p <0.0001), the extent of inhibition was greater with rosuvastatin (18 +/- 2% vs 8 +/- 2%, p = 0.0006). Statins also improved FMD from 7.4 +/- 0.6 to 9.3 +/- 0.4 (p = 0.003) with rosuvastatin being slightly better than atorvastatin. The inhibition of ROCK activity by statins did not correlate with reductions in LDL (p = 0.57) but was associated with improvement in FMD.

The main objective of this project is to develop an efficient, operator-free, intraoperative seed detection technique using the imaging modalities available in a low dose rate brachytherapy treatment room.   METHODS This intraoperative detection allows a complete dosimetry calculation that can be performed right after an I-125 prostate seed implantation, while the patient is still under anesthesia. To accomplish this, a digital tomosynthesis-based algorithm was developed. This automatic filtered reconstruction of the 3D volume requires seven projections acquired over a total angle of 60 degrees with an isocentric imaging system.   RESULTS A phantom study was performed to validate the technique that was used in a retrospective clinical study involving 23 patients. In the patient study, the automatic tomosynthesis-based reconstruction yielded seed detection rates of 96.7% and 2.6% false positives. The seed localization error obtained with a phantom study is 0.4 +/- 0.4 mm. The average time needed for reconstruction is below 1 min. The reconstruction algorithm also provides the seed orientation with an uncertainty of 10 degrees +/- 8 degrees. The seed detection algorithm presented here is reliable and was efficiently used in the clinic.

METHODS Fifty-two patients with suspicion of cerebral glioma were included in this study. From 30 to 50 min after injection of 180 MBq (18)F-FET, a first PET scan ((18)F-FET scan) was performed. Thereafter, 240 MBq (18)F-FDG was injected and a second PET scan was acquired from 30 to 60 min after the second injection ((18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan). The cerebral accumulation of (18)F-FDG was calculated by decay corrected subtraction of the (18)F-FET scan from the (18)F-FET/(18)F-FDG scan. Tracer uptake was evaluated by visual scoring and by lesion-to-background (L/B) ratios. The imaging results were compared with the histological results and prognosis.   RESULTS Histology revealed 24 low-grade gliomas (LGG) of World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II and 19 high-grade gliomas (HGG) of WHO Grade III or IV, as well as nine others, mainly benign histologies. The gliomas showed increased (18)F-FET uptake (>normal brain) in 86% and increased (18)F-FDG uptake (>white matter) in 35%. (18)F-FET PET provided diagnostically useful delineation of tumor extent while this was impractical with (18)F-FDG due to high tracer uptake in the gray matter. A local maximum in the tumor area for biopsy guidance could be identified with (18)F-FET in 76% and with (18)F-FDG in 28%. The L/B ratios showed significant differences between LGG and HGG for both tracers but considerable overlap so that reliable preoperative grading was not possible. A significant correlation of tracer uptake with overall survival was found with (18)F-FDG only. In some benign lesions like abscesses, increased uptake was observed for both tracers indicating a limited specificity of both techniques.   CONCLUSIONS (18)F-FET PET is superior to (18)F-FDG for biopsy guidance and treatment planning of cerebral gliomas. The uptake of (18)F-FDG is associated with prognosis, but the predictive value is limited and a histological evaluation of tumor tissue remains necessary.

Methods This was a multi-centre, cross-sectional disease study involving 15 selected general practices throughout South Africa. Treated hypertensive patients over 18 years old were eligible for inclusion. The study was approved by Pharma Ethics, and after informed consent, consecutive hypertensive patients at the participating general practice centres were included, with each centre enrolling 30 patients. Results A total of 451 patients, from 15 sites in South Africa, were entered in the study. The mean age of the patients was 60.7 years, 56.3% were female and 15.7% were current smokers. The BP was reduced by 26.4/17.6 mmHg (p < 0.001) in 220 patients with a documented initial BP. Co-morbidities were present in 322 (71.4%) patients and overall, 37.9% had more than one co-morbidity.

BACKGROUND There is relative uncertainty about the relationship between clopidogrel and CABG-associated outcomes in the setting of ACS.   METHODS A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of randomly selected ACS patients requiring CABG in 14 hospitals across the U.S. Patients exposed to clopidogrel were compared with those not exposed to clopidogrel within 5 days prior to surgery.   RESULTS Of the 596 patients enrolled in the study, 298 had been exposed to clopidogrel within 5 days (Group A). Patients in Group A were more than 3-fold more likely to require reoperation for assessment of bleeding than patients not exposed to clopidogrel (6.4% vs. 1.7% Group B, p = 0.004). Major bleeding occurred in 35% of Group A patients versus 26% of Group B patients (p = 0.049). Length of stay was greater in Group A compared with Group B (9.7 +/- 6.0 days vs. 8.6 +/- 4.7 days, unadjusted p = 0.016). After logistic regression analysis, clopidogrel exposure within 5 days of CABG was the strongest predictor of reoperation (odds ratio [OR]: 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 14.55) and major bleeding (OR: 1.824, 95% CI: 1.106 to 3.008).   CONCLUSIONS After ACS, patients who undergo CABG within 5 days of receiving clopidogrel are at increased risk for reoperation, major bleeding, and increased length of stay.

It requires interaction between HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env, composed of gp120 and gp41), expressed at the surface of infected cells, and HIV-1 receptors, CD4 and a coreceptor, on the target cells. The gp120 interacts first with CD4, which triggers conformational changes leading to increased exposure of gp120 regions (including the V3 loop) able to bind to the coreceptor, mainly CCR5 or CXCR4. This interaction induces a structural rearrangement in gp41, insertion of its N terminus fusion peptide into the target membrane, and fusion. R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains use CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively, for entry. We have previously demonstrated that, independently of HIV-1 replication, X4 HIV-infected cells trigger autophagy in the uninfected CD4 T lymphocytes. Env-mediated autophagy is dependent on the gp41 fusogenic activity but is independent of a direct CD4- and CXCR4-mediated signaling pathway. Furthermore, this autophagy process is required to trigger CD4 T cell apoptosis since blockade of autophagy at different steps, by either drugs or short interfering RNAs specific for autophagy genes, totally inhibits Env-mediated apoptosis. Our last results show that autophagy and cell death are also induced in the uninfected CD4 T cells by HIV-1 R5 Env, while autophagy is inhibited in productively X4 or R5-infected CD4 T cells. In contrast, uninfected macrophages, a preserved cell population during HIV-1 infection, do not undergo X4 or R5 Env-mediated autophagy. Autophagosomes, however, are present in macrophages exposed to infectious HIV-1 particles, independently of coreceptor use. Interestingly, two populations of autophagic macrophages can be observed during their coculture with HIV-1-infected cells: one highly autophagic and the other weakly autophagic. Surprisingly, viruses could be detected in the weakly autophagic cells but not in the highly autophagic cells. In addition, we show that the triggering of autophagy in macrophages is necessary for viral replication but addition of Bafilomycin A1, which blocks the final stages of autophagy, strongly increases productive infection. Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a complex, but essential, role in HIV pathology by regulating both viral replication and the fate of the target cells.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 3}, {"paper_id": "5d7b9ca3bc61e3e815e827defc85f680ff507f57", "text": "Conflicting data have been reported on the risk for venous thrombosis in subjects with low free protein S levels.

Addition of isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) to propranolol improves its hemodynamic efficacy; we investigated whether a combination of EVL and propranolol/ISMN was more effective than EVL alone for secondary prophylaxis.   METHODS Patients with a prior variceal bleed were randomly assigned to groups given a combination (n = 88) of EVL, propranolol (dose titrated to reduce heart rate to 55 beats per minute), and ISMN (40 mg/day) or EVL alone (n = 89). Primary end points were rebleeding or death; secondary end points were new complications of portal hypertension or serious adverse effects.   RESULTS The actuarial probabilities of rebleeding 2 years after therapy were 27% in the combination group and 31% in the EVL alone group (P = .822). Two patients in the combination group and 3 patients in the EVL alone group died during the study period (P = .682); no deaths were caused by variceal hemorrhage.

Changes in lipoprotein particle concentration may predict the risk of coronary heart disease more accurately than lipoprotein cholesterol levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome (n = 318) were randomly assigned in a double-blind study comparing 10 mg rosuvastatin (RSV), 10 mg atorvastatin, or placebo daily for 6 weeks. From weeks 6 to 12, patients in the RSV and placebo groups received 20 mg RSV, whereas the ATV group increased their dose to 20 mg daily. Lipoprotein particle concentrations were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, LDL cholesterol was measured by \u03b2-quantification, and other lipoproteins were measured by standard methods at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Lipoprotein levels were compared by analysis of covariance. RESULTS Statins reduced LDL particle concentration less than LDL cholesterol (\u221230 to \u221238 vs. \u221238 to \u221251%). Reductions were greater with RSV than with ATV (P < 0.05 for LDL particle concentration and P < 0.001 for LDL cholesterol). Most patients attained LDL cholesterol <2.59 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) at 12 weeks (80% with RSV and 59% with ATV; P = 0.003), but only 27% of patients receiving RSV and 19% receiving ATV attained the goal of LDL particle concentration <1,000 nmol/l (P = 0.07).

METHODS Inspiratory capacity (IC) of 16 patients with COPD (age: 63+/- 13 years; FEV(1) of 1.5+/-0.7 L-41+/-11% predicted) was measured before and after an incremental arm exercise test (diagonal technique) with randomly and double-blinded inhaled placebo or salbutamol.

There was a decrease in the IC after a maximal incremental arm exercise test, 222+/-158 ml (p=0.001) with placebo use, but no change was seen after the salbutamol use: 104+/-205 ml (p=0.41); 62% of the patients presented a 10% or more reduction in the IC after the exercise with placebo.

Therefore, the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr An\u00e4sthesiologie und Intensivmedizin, DGAI) and the Professional Association of German Anaesthetists (Berufsverband Deutscher An\u00e4sthesisten, BDA) initiated a network for safety in regional anaesthesia. From this the first results on infectious complications will be reported.Materials and methodsIn a Delphi process the documentation of the setup and maintenance of regional anaesthesia and analgesia was agreed with the participants in a working group from the DGAI. After approval by the officially authorized representative for patient data privacy protection a registry was programmed to collect anonymous data. Up to October 2008 data from 6 centers could be analyzed.ResultsAfter testing for plausibility 8,781 regional anaesthesia procedures (22,112 catheter days) could be analyzed. The 5,057 neuraxial and 3,724 peripheral catheter-based procedures were in place for a median of 2.48 days (range 1.0-3.0 days) and 4 severe, 15 moderate and 128 mild infections were recorded. Diabetics were not found to show a statistically significant increase in risk (2.6% compared to 1.9% for non-diabetics: n.s.). Neuraxial procedures seem to have a higher rate of infections than peripheral procedures (2.7% vs. 1.3%, p<0.0001). Multiple punctures of the skin also seem to be associated with a higher infection rate than single skin punctures (4.1% vs. 1.6%, p<0.0001).ConclusionsInfectious complications of catheter-based regional anaesthesia are common.

This trial assessed the feasibility, safety, and provided insights into the efficacy of this therapy.   DESIGN This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.   LOCATIONS The study locations were an academic research center, teaching hospital, and affiliated Integrative Medicine Center in Derby, CT.   SUBJECTS The subjects were 34 adults with American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-defined FMS.   INTERVENTION Subjects were randomly assigned either to treatment (weekly infusions of IVMT) or to placebo (weekly infusions of lactated Ringer's solution) for 8 weeks.   OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was change in the Tender Point Index, assessed 8 and 12 weeks after initiation. Secondary measures included a Visual Analog Scale to assess global pain, and validated measures of physical function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), mood (Beck Depression Index), and quality of life (Health Status Questionnaire 2.0).   RESULTS Clinically significant improvements were noted (of a magnitude similar to other effective interventions). However, in part because of the high placebo response and the small sample size, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups, in any outcome measure, at 8 and 16 weeks. Statistically significant within-group differences were seen in both the intervention and placebo groups, demonstrating a treatment effect for both IVMT and placebo. At 8 weeks, the IVMT group experienced significantly improved tender points, pain, depression, and quality of life directly following treatment (all p < or = 0.02), while the placebo group experienced significantly improved tender points only (p < or = 0.05). The treatment effects of IVMT persisted at 4 weeks postintervention for tender points, pain, and quality of life, while placebo effects persisted only for tender points. A single minor adverse event was noted in one subject in the intervention group.   CONCLUSIONS This first controlled pilot study established the safety and feasibility of treating FMS with IVMT. Most subjects experienced relief as compared to baseline, but no statistically significant differences were seen between IVMT and placebo.

Many children suffered or witnessed horrifying acts of violence and aggression. Although young trauma victims are often resilient, many experience mental health difficulties, including PTSD. The aim of the study was to estimate whether psychosocial support given by the School Project of Humanitarian Association of \" Prijateljice\" reduced posttraumatic consequences in students in primary and secondary schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina after 1992-1995 war.   SUBJECTS AND METHODS A stratified sample of 336 students in primary and secondary schools located in two entities of North-East Bosnia and Herzegovina, involved in psychosocial support, was compared with 72 voluntarily selected same-age students from the same schools who were not involved in this project. Data were collected on two occasions, beginning of December 2005 and end of May 2006, by using a self-evaluation survey method for measuring symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to DSM IV.

The second phase of the randomized trial compared a less intensive intervention, facilitated bone mineral density (BMD) testing, with usual care and the case manager intervention.   METHODS We initially randomized 220 hip fracture patients to either an OP case manager intervention or usual care. After completing the original trial at 6 months postfracture, usual care patients were reallocated to facilitated BMD testing; BMD tests were arranged and results sent to primary care physicians. Main outcomes (bisphosphonate treatment, BMD tests, receipt of appropriate care) were reascertained 1 year following hip fracture and compared with outcomes achieved by the OP case manager intervention and usual care.   RESULTS Compared with usual care, facilitated BMD testing increased testing from 29% to 68% (P < 0.001), bisphosphonate use from 22% to 38% (P < 0.001), and receipt of appropriate care from 26% to 45% (P < 0.001). The more intensive (70 versus 30 minutes) and expensive ($56 versus $24 Canadian per patient) OP case manager intervention led to significantly higher bisphosphonate use (54% versus 38%; P = 0.03), receipt of appropriate care (71% versus 45%; P < 0.001), and more BMD testing (80% versus 68%; P = 0.06) than usual care followed by facilitated BMD testing.

Left ventricular end-systolic volume (ESV) is a relatively load-independent echocardiographic marker of contractility that is easily measured. We investigated the role of the change in ESV at rest and after peak exercise on mortality among patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD).   METHODS AND RESULTS We performed exercise treadmill testing with stress echocardiography in 934 ambulatory subjects with CHD. End-systolic volume was measured immediately before and after exercise using 2D echocardiography. We defined ESV reversal as an increase in ESV after exercise, and we examined the association of ESV reversal with all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 3.92 years. Of the 934 participants, 199 (21%) had ESV reversal. At the end of follow-up, mortality was higher among participants with ESV reversal than those without (26 vs. 11%; P < 0.001). After adjustment for clinical covariates, ESV reversal remained predictive of all-cause mortality (HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4-2.9; P = 0.001). The association of ESV reversal with mortality also persisted after adjustment for exercise-induced wall-motion abnormalities (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.3, P = 0.006). To determine if the effect of ESV reversal was independent from other echocardiographic measurements, we created a separate model adjusting for resting LV ejection fraction, ESV, end-diastolic volume, and LV mass. End-systolic volume reversal was the only significant predictor of mortality in this model (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.0, P < 0.001).   CONCLUSION End-systolic volume reversal is a novel parameter that independently predicts mortality in patients with CHD undergoing exercise treadmill echocardiography, even after adjustment for a wide range of clinical, echocardiographic, and treadmill exercise variables. Because measurement of ESV is simple, reproducible, and requires no additional imaging views, identification of ESV reversal during exercise echocardiography can provide useful complementary information for risk stratification.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 14}, {"paper_id": "d18c910d556153c7a08b0a3325bf58558842555d", "text": "Miyamoto S, Kondo T, Suzukamo Y, Michimata A, Izumi S-I: Reliability and validity of the manual function test in patients with stroke.

The aim was to compare the safety and efficacy of the two. Design:Randomized, nonblinded, controlled single-center trial. Setting:General intensive care unit of a teaching hospital. Patients:Adult critically ill patients needing CVVH for acute renal failure and without an increased bleeding risk. Interventions:Regional anticoagulation with citrate or systemic anticoagulation with the low-molecular weight heparin nadroparin. Measurements and Main Results:End points were adverse events necessitating discontinuation of study anticoagulant, transfusion, metabolic and clinical outcomes, and circuit survival. Of the 215 randomized patients, 200 received CVVH per protocol (97 citrate and 103 nadroparin). Adverse events required discontinuation of citrate in two patients (accumulation and clotting) of nadroparin in 20 (bleeding and thrombocytopenia) (p < 0.001). Bleeding occurred in 6 vs. 16 patients (p = 0.08). The median number of red blood cell units transfused per CVVH day was 0.27 (interquartile range, 0.0\u20130.63) for citrate, 0.36 (interquartile range, 0\u20130.83) for nadroparin (p = 0.31). Citrate conferred less metabolic alkalosis (p = 0.001) and lower plasma calcium (p < 0.001). Circuit survival was similar.

There are problems with the diagnosis of asthma in young children since the majority of the children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms is symptom free at 6 years, and does not have asthma. With the conventional diagnostic tools it is not possible to differentiate between preschool children with transient symptoms and children with asthma. The analysis of biomarkers of airway inflammation in exhaled breath is a non-invasive and promising technique to diagnose asthma and monitor inflammation in young children. Moreover, relatively new lung function tests (airway resistance using the interrupter technique) have become available for young children. The primary objective of the ADEM study (Asthma DEtection and Monitoring study), is to develop a non-invasive instrument for an early asthma diagnosis in young children, using exhaled inflammatory markers and early lung function measurements. In addition, aetiological factors, including gene polymorphisms and gene expression profiles, in relation to the development of asthma are studied.Methods/designA prospective case-control study is started in 200 children with recurrent respiratory symptoms and 50 control subjects without respiratory symptoms. At 6 years, a definite diagnosis of asthma is made (primary outcome measure) on basis of lung function assessments and current respiratory symptoms ('golden standard'). From inclusion until the definite asthma diagnosis, repeated measurements of lung function tests and inflammatory markers in exhaled breath (condensate), blood and faeces are performed. The study is registered and ethically approved.DiscussionThis article describes the study protocol of the ADEM study. The new diagnostic techniques applied in this study could make an early diagnosis of asthma possible. An early and reliable asthma diagnosis at 2\u20133 years will have consequences for the management of the large group of young children with asthma-like symptoms. It will avoid both over-treatment of children with transient wheeze and under-treatment of children with asthma. This might have a beneficial influence on the prognosis of asthma in these young children.

This pathophysiology-orientated patient selection criterion for acute stroke treatment may have the potential to replace a fixed time window. Two recent trials - DEFUSE and EPITHET - investigated the mismatch concept in a multicenter prospective approach. Both studies randomized highly selected patients (n = 74/n = 100) and therefore confirmation in a large consecutive cohort is desirable. We here present a single-center approach with a 3T MR tomograph next door to the stroke unit, serving as a bridge from the ER to the stroke unit to screen all TIA and stroke patients. Our primary hypothesis is that the prognostic value of the mismatch concept is depending on the vessel status. Primary endpoint of the study is infarct growth determined by imaging, secondary endpoints are neurological deficit on day 5-7 and functional outcome after 3 months.Methods and design1000Plus is a prospective, single centre observational study with 1200 patients to be recruited. All patients admitted to the ER with the clinical diagnosis of an acute cerebrovascular event within 24 hours after symptom onset are screened. Examinations are performed on day 1, 2 and 5-7 with neurological examination including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scoring and stroke MRI including T2*, DWI, TOF-MRA, FLAIR and PI. PI is conducted as dynamic susceptibility-enhanced contrast imaging with a fixed dosage of 5 ml 1 M Gadobutrol. For post-processing of PI, mean transit time (MTT) parametric images are determined by deconvolution of the arterial input function (AIF) which is automatically identified. Lesion volumes and mismatch are measured and calculated by using the perfusion mismatch analyzer (PMA) software from ASIST-Japan. Primary endpoint is the change of infarct size between baseline examination and day 5-7 follow up.DiscussionsThe aim of this study is to describe the incidence of mismatch and the predictive value of PI for final lesion size and functional outcome depending on delay of imaging and vascular recanalization.

In the experimental group, a customised programme of treatment was based on postisometric relaxation of muscles and ligaments, active mobilisation of the spine, Kibler Fold mobilisation, Kinesiology Taping and Maigne's relaxing exercises. the control group underwent electrotherapy procedures and performed a set of exercises usually recommended for low back pain. Intensity of pain and difficulty in performing daily activities were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the treatment: the measurements included mobility of the spine, static balance of the pelvis, tenderness and tension of muscles and ligaments and presence of cell-pain zones. Statistics analysis used basic statistics concerning the distribution of the examined characteristics and a comparison of means in independent groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.   RESULTS As a result of the treatment, low back pain was reduced in about 90% of patients in the experimental group, while static balance of the pelvis, tone of the muscles and ligaments and spinal mobility improved in approximately 80% of these patients. In the control group, radiating pain decreased and ligaments in 25% of participants, white the other parameters did not change significantly. The results were statistically significant at < 0.05.

METHODS A multicenter study was conducted and included 222 patients who underwent EUS examination with assessment of a pancreatic mass (n = 121) or lymph node (n = 101). The classification as benign or malignant, based on the real time elastography pattern, was compared with the classification based on the B-mode EUS images and with the final diagnosis obtained by EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and/or by surgical pathology. An interobserver study was performed.   RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of EUS elastography to differentiate benign from malignant pancreatic lesions are 92.3% and 80.0%, respectively, compared to 92.3% and 68.9%, respectively, for the conventional B-mode images. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS elastography to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes was 91.8% and 82.5%, respectively, compared to 78.6% and 50.0%, respectively, for the B-mode images. The kappa coefficient was 0.785 for the pancreatic masses and 0.657 for the lymph nodes.   CONCLUSION EUS elastography is superior compared to conventional B-mode imaging and appears to be able to distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic masses and lymph nodes with a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It might be reserved as a second line examination to help characterise pancreatic masses after negative EUS-FNA and might increase the yield of EUS-FNA for lymph nodes.", "1_year_count": 15, "label": 229}, {"paper_id": "7e123d9f28e62dac94ccd4121e815099004c3b76", "text": "BACKGROUND For the past decade, percentage of ideal body weight (%IBW) was recommended by European and US nutrition consensus reports as preferred clinical measure of nutritional status in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We and others have demonstrated that the %IBW method underestimates the prevalence of nutritional failure in CF, but the underlying mechanism for this methodological flaw remains incompletely defined.   DESIGN We performed model calculations from cross sectional growth data of healthy and CF-children to assess the methodological limitations of %IBW calculation.   RESULTS Here we demonstrate that an intrinsic limitation of %IBW method is that it largely ignores the statistical principle of regression to the mean. The key assumption of %IBW is that ideal weight-for-age is on exactly the same percentile ranking as height-for-age. We show that this assumption is only valid if the individual's height is close to the reference median. When the stature deviates from the median of the reference population, however, the increments of height-for-age and weight-for-age percentiles are not the same. In consequence, %IBW method systematically underestimates the ideal weight for smaller-than-average individuals, like CF-patients, which results in significant underestimation of the prevalence of malnutrition in this group of patients.   CONCLUSION There is increasing scientific evidence that calculation of %IBW as a measure of nutritional status in children with CF is flawed and should be discontinued. It is expected that future guidelines will recommend the use of alternative measures of weight-for-height proportion, e.g. BMI percentiles, to assess underweight and malnutrition in patients with CF.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 8}, {"paper_id": "8af86b0aaa0a99c96d661ef10958e5579a43361a", "text": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing a vital role in an ever-growing number of applications ranging from environmental surveillance over medical monitoring to home automation. Since WSNs are often deployed in unattended or even hostile environments, they can be subject to various malicious attacks, including the manipulation and capture of nodes. The establishment of a shared secret key between two or more individual nodes is one of the most important security services needed to guarantee the proper functioning of a sensor network. Despite some recent advances in this field, the efficient implementation of cryptographic key establishment for WSNs remains a challenge due to the resource constraints of small sensor nodes such as the MICAz mote. In this paper we present a lightweight implementation of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange for ZigBee-compliant sensor nodes equipped with an ATmega128 processor running the TinyOS operating system. Our implementation uses a 192-bit prime field specified by the NIST as underlying algebraic structure and requires only 5.20 \u00b7106 clock cycles to compute a scalar multiplication if the base point is fixed and known a priori. A scalar multiplication using a random base point takes about 12.33 \u00b7106 cycles.

We investigate how spontaneous transitions (i.e. not forced by DC shock) between these states are influenced by factors like age, gender, bystander CPR, CPR quality, proportion of time spent in a state, or the number of state transitions.   METHODS Detailed recordings from CPR attempts in 304 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Akershus (Norway), Stockholm (Sweden), and London (UK) were obtained from modified Heartstart 4000 defibrillators. Spontaneous state transitions were studied using a non-parametric intensity regression method that can handle dynamic factors like the state history properly.   RESULTS The initial state tended to preserve itself, as did cumulative time in any state. Recent DC shock, bystander CPR, location, response time, gender, compression depth, and ventilation rate were important for some transitions. More ventilation during PEA might possibly avert development to ASY and favour ROSC; otherwise observed variations in CPR quality had little impact.   CONCLUSION Using a novel intensity regression approach we studied the influence of various factors on spontaneous (i.e. non-shock) state transitions during CPR.

GLUT4 expression and function are diminished in diabetic human and animal subjects. The goal of the present study is to develop a cell-based assay for identifying negative regulators of GLUT4 translocation as potential targets for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Traditional GLUT4 translocation assays performed in differentiated myocytes or adipocytes are difficult to perform, particularly in HTS (high-throughput screening) mode. In the present study, we stably co-expressed c-Myc and eGFP [enhanced GFP (green fluorescent protein)] dual-tagged recombinant GLUT4 with recombinant IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) (HEK-293.IRS1.GLUT4 cells). Insulin treatment stimulated both glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in these cells. GLUT4 translocation is quantified by a TRF (time-resolved fluorescence) assay in a 96-well HTS format. TRF assays confirmed insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, which can be inhibited by PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) or Akt [also called PKB (protein kinase B)] inhibitors. Treatment with palmitate increased IRS1 serine phosphorylation and reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation, indicating insulin resistance. Knockdown of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) and PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) gene expression by siRNA (small interfering RNA) treatment significantly increased GLUT4 translocation only in cells treated with palmitate but not in untreated cells. Similar results were obtained on treatment with siRNA of JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), S6K1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1) and PKC(theta) (protein kinase C theta). In summary, we have established and validated a novel GLUT4 translocation assay that is optimal for identifying negative regulators of GLUT4 translocation.

Hypertension is a chronic disorder with a high prevalence worldwide. Despite considerable efforts, it is sometimes hard to reach treatment goals for blood pressure (BP) with classical treatment options. Reducing breathing frequency has been advocated as a method to reduce BP. Methods. A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted in 30 non-diabetic patients with hypertension over a period of 9 weeks to evaluate the effect of a device that helps to slow breathing (Resperate\u00ae) on BP and quality of life (QoL). The control group listened to music and used no other therapeutic device. Results. There was no significant difference in change in BP between intervention and control; BP \u20134.2mmHg (95% CI \u201312.4 to 3.9)/\u20132.6mmHg (95% CI \u20138.4 to 3.3). This result did not alter in post hoc analyses, when patients not achieving target breathing frequency (<10 breaths/min) or non-compliant patients were excluded. QoL did not change over time. Conclusions. We found no effect of the Resperate\u00ae on BP or QoL compared with the control group. We conclude that, at this moment, this device has no added value in the treatment of hypertension.

We hypothesized that decreased CYP2C19 activity affects the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel but not prasugrel. Methods and results Ninety-eight patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) taking either clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose (LD)/75 mg maintenance dose (MD) or prasugrel 60 mg LD/10 mg MD were genotyped for variation in six CYP genes. Based on CYP genotype, patients were segregated into two groups: normal function (extensive) metabolizers (EM) and reduced function metabolizers (RM). Plasma active metabolite concentrations were measured at 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-LD and during the MD period on Day 2, Day 14, and Day 29 at 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 h.

Setting: Level I trauma center. Methods: During a 3-year period (July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2006), 58 patients with vertically unstable pelvic injuries were treated with triangular osteosynthesis fixation by a single surgeon at a single institution. Patients were followed-up prospectively as a single cohort, with institutional review board approval. Inclusion criteria for this study were skeletally mature patients with a vertically unstable pelvic ring injury associated with a comminuted transforaminal sacral fracture. Minimum follow-up, both clinically and radiographically, was 1 year. Computed tomography scan was performed on all patients at 6 months to assess healing of the fracture. If the fracture healed, the fixation was removed. Functional outcome was assessed using the Short Form 36, version 2, and short version of Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment questionnaires at 6 months (before fixation removal) and 12 months. Results: Forty of 58 patients with an average age of 39 years were available for a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Wound complications requiring surgical debridement occurred in 5 patients (13%), all of whom had severe soft tissue wounds with internal degloving. Two patients required removal of infected fixation. Iatrogenic L5 nerve injury occurred in 5 patients (13%). Ten patients (25%) had a delayed union on computed tomography scans, and 3 patients had a nonunion as a result of residual fracture gap and incomplete reduction. Six patients (15%) were found to have pronounced tilting of the L5 vertebral body (scoliosis) and distraction of the L5/S1 facet joint ipsilateral to the fixation. This did not correct with removal of the fixation. Failure of the triangular osteosynthesis construct resulting in malunion occurred in 2 patients (5%). All but 2 patients (95%) complained of painful and prominent implants. Functional outcome scoring showed that patients continued to function below the population mean at 1 year but continued to improve, particularly with function and daily activity. Ninety-seven percent of patients returned to some form of work or schooling. Conclusions: Triangular osteosynthesis fixation is a reliable form of fixation that allows early full weight-bearing at 6 weeks while preventing loss of reduction in comminuted vertical shear transforaminal sacral fractures. For this study group, operative reduction was maintained until healing in 95% of patients. However, the 1-year follow-up shows a substantial rate of potential technical problems and complications. Of primary concern were the asymmetric L5 tilting with L5-S1 facet joint distraction and the need for a second surgery in all patients to remove painful fixation. Iatrogenic nerve injury occurred in 5 patients (13%) and is thought to arise secondary to fracture manipulation and reduction.

Urinary calcium excretion significantly increased after day 7 in both groups. The increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at day 7 in the control group was not observed in the alendronate group, but PTH levels increased at day 28 and month 3 in the alendronate group.

We conducted intratumoral administration of an allogeneic irradiated continuous T-cell line (C-Cure 709) expressing an HLA-A2-restricted MART-1-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) into HLA-A2(+) melanoma patients. The C-Cure 709 cell line is cytotoxic against MART-1(+) HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell lines and secretes several immune stimulatory cytokines upon stimulation.   METHODS Anti-tumor immune responses against the commonly expressed tumor antigen (Ag) MART-1 were longitudinally analyzed in peripheral blood by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) before and after intratumoral injection of C-Cure 709.   RESULTS No treatment-induced increase in Ag-specific T-cell frequencies was observed in peripheral blood, and the phenotype of MART-1-specific T cells was very stable during the treatment. Interestingly, despite a very stable frequency of MART-1-specific T cells over the course of treatment, clonotype mapping revealed that the response was in fact highly diverse and dynamic, with new clonotypes emerging during treatment. Only a few clonotypes were recurrently detected in consecutive samples. One MART-1-specific T-cell clone disappearing from peripheral blood was later detected in a metastatic lesion.

PARTICIPANTS A total of 444 participants enrolled in the study (mean age = 42.07 years; 63.28% male; 51.80% European American; mean cigarettes/day = 18.27).   INTERVENTIONS SC participants received two brief sessions with a health educator. Those setting a quit date received self-help quitting materials and NRT. ME participants received four sessions of motivational counseling and a quit-day counseling call. All ME intervention materials were tailored to the needs of HIV+ individuals.   MEASUREMENTS Biochemically verified 7-day abstinence rates at 2-month, 4-month and 6-month follow-ups.   FINDINGS Intent-to-treat (ITT) abstinence rates at 2-month, 4-month and 6-month follow-ups were 12%, 9% and 9%, respectively, in the ME condition, and 13%, 10% and 10%, respectively, in the SC condition, indicating no between-group differences.

Methods: Adult cancer patients receiving stable background opioid treatment and experiencing BTP episodes were recruited from 44 study centres in seven European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom); of the 196 patients enrolled, 139 were randomised to receive INFS followed by OTFC, or vice versa. Patients were titrated to an effective dose of one agent (50, 100 or 200\u2009\u00b5g INFS; 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200 or 1600\u2009\u00b5g OTFC) to treat six BTP episodes, then titration and treatment were repeated with the other agent. The primary outcome was patient-recorded time to onset of \u2018meaningful\u2019 pain relief. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity difference (PID) at 10 and 30\u2009minutes (PID10, PID30), sum of PID at 15 and 60\u2009minutes (SPID0\u201315, SPID0\u201360), ease of administration, treatment preference and relationship between background opioid dose and effective INFS dose. Additional outcome measures included proportions of episodes with \u226533% and \u226550% pain intensity (PI) reduction, and PID at additional time points.

Results: Among the intention-to-treat population (n\u2009=\u2009139), median time to onset of \u2018meaningful\u2019 pain relief was 11\u2009minutes with INFS versus 16\u2009minutes with OTFC; 65.7% of patients attained faster time to \u2018meaningful\u2019 pain-relief onset with INFS (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

In CF, chronic infection and dysregulated neutrophilic inflammation lead to progressive airway destruction. The severity of CF lung disease has significant heritability, independent of CFTR genotype1. To identify genetic modifiers, we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan in one cohort of CF patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of CF lung disease severity. IFRD1 is a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent transcriptional co-regulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation.

RESULTS The 2 groups were similar with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, revised cardiac risk index, and type of vascular surgery performed. The myocardial revascularization rate in group B was higher than in group A (58.1% vs. 40.1%; p = 0.01).

Similarly, significantly greater improvements were observed with ABT-335 + atorvastatin 40 mg in TG (-42.1% vs -23.2%) and HDL cholesterol (12.6% vs 5.3%) compared with atorvastatin 40 mg and LDL cholesterol (-35.4% vs -3.4%) compared with ABT-335 monotherapy. Combination therapy also improved multiple secondary variables. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with those of ABT-335 and atorvastatin monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis was reported. In conclusion, ABT-335 + atorvastatin combination therapy resulted in more effective control of multiple lipid parameters than either monotherapy and may be an appropriate therapy for patients with mixed dyslipidemia.", "1_year_count": 28, "label": 64}, {"paper_id": "c32e997f8e1e10d476109e2256d13c8c377e00cd", "text": "The CAAS QCA\u20103D system (Pie Medical Imaging BV, the Netherlands) was validated against 3D reconstructions based on fusion of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (ANGUS), allowing slice by slice validation of the lumen areas and 3D geometric values.", "1_year_count": 6, "label": 64}, {"paper_id": "45a86164001dcf50fbaeba5a14f2153d1a9b9959", "text": "BGP routing policies are mainly used by network operators to enforce business relationships between Autonomous Systems (AS), and to prefer some routes over others.

A two-way crossover study of olmesartan medoxomil and azelnidipine was conducted in 29 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM) and plasma drug concentrations were obtained on the first and at the end of each treatment period, and were analyzed using population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling approach. The population PK/PD models considering circadian variations in baseline blood pressure well described the observed plasma drug concentrations and 24-hour ABPM profiles. Pre-treatment plasma renin activity (PRA) was identified as a significant covariate on the maximum drug effect (E(max)) of olmesartan, whereas azelnidpine E(max) was independent of patient background characteristics investigated. No patient was found to have a high E(max) to one agent who also had a high E(max) to the other. In conclusion, the effects of olmesartan medoxomil and azelnidipine were modestly correlated with pharmacokinetic profiles, and the pre-treatment PRA level could be a useful determinant of responsiveness in selecting olmesartan medoxomil and azelnidipine.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 19}, {"paper_id": "9bf89d741fa9d70d9dbf2fbc99deb05f6cc8ad4c", "text": "Introduction: A UK multicenter study compared the performance of contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging with X-Ray Mammography in women at high-risk of breast cancer commencing in 1997. Selection criteria were used to identify women with at least 0.9% annual risk of breast cancer. Methods: Women at high breast cancer risk, with a strong family history and/or high probability of a BRCA1/BRCA2/TP53 mutation, were recruited from 22 centers. Those not known as gene carriers were asked to give a blood sample, which was tested anonymously for mutations. Women ages 35 to 49 years were offered annual screening for 2 to 7 years. Study eligibility at entry was assessed retrospectively by detailed examination of pedigrees and overall eligibility accounting for computer risk assessment and mutation results. Results: Seventy-eight of 837 (9%) women entered for screening were ineligible using the strict entry criteria. Thirty-nine cancers were detected in 1,869 women-years in study (incidence 21 per 1,000). Including 3,561 further years follow-up, 28 more breast cancers were identified (12 of 1,000). Incidence rates for 759 eligible women were 22 of 1,000 in study and 13 of 1,000 in total follow-up, compared with 9 of 1,000 and 4 of 1,000, respectively, in 78 ineligible women. Breast cancer rates were higher for BRCA2 than BRCA1 after testing anonymized samples in this selected population at 65 of 1,000 in study and 36 of 1,000 in total follow-up for BRCA2 compared with 44 of 1,000 and 27 of 1,000 for BRCA1. Conclusions: Strict enforcement of study criteria would have minimally improved the power of the study, whereas testing for BRCA1/2 in advance would have substantially increased the detection rates.

Efficacy and Safety Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease Adjunct (101468/169) compared ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release or placebo in patients with advanced PD not optimally controlled with l-dopa. Sparse blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluations through population analysis. The relationship between ropinirole systemic exposure [steady-state area under the curve between time zero and 24 hours after dose, AUC(0-24,ss)] and change from baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total motor score, and awake time spent off was investigated. Results:In EASE-PD Monotherapy, the relationship between the decrease in UPDRS motor score and AUC(0-24,ss) was similar for both formulations, with a 60% to 80% probability of response for the exposure range studied. In patients with early PD, similar clinical benefit was achieved at AUC(0-24,ss) values associated with doses of 8 to 12 mg and higher doses (up to 24 mg).

Up to now, standardized instruments to evaluate these treatment goals are still missing. We present results of analyses of the psychometric properties of the Hamburg Self-Care Questionnaire (HamSCQ). Besides reliability we are focusing on diff erent aspects of validity: factor structure, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. Methods: A total sample of 7 478 inpatients with mental disorders from four diff erent psychotherapeutic clinics participated in the study. Patients completed self-rating questionnaires at admission and discharge: Besides the HamSCQ we used the Symptom Checklist SCL-14, the Short Form SF-8, the CES-D depression scale, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems IIP-25 and the AVEM. Results: The two-dimensional structure of the HamSCQ with the two subscales Pacing and Positive Experience could be replicated by means of both principal component and confi rmatory factor analysis. The two scales correlate with r = 0.56. Both scales show a high internal consistency (alpha \u2265 0.90), they correlate with the selected measures of concurrent validity (except the AVEM scales) with medium (Pacing) or high (Positive Experience) eff ect sizes, and their mean scores diff er signifi cantly from admission to discharge with large eff ect sizes. Conclusions: The HamSCQ proves to be a reliable questionnaire, which is also sensitive to change. The two-dimensional factor structure could be replicated, and some aspects of concurrent validity could be demonstrated, but concerning criterion validity further research is still necessary. Thus we recommend the use of the HamSCQ for inpatients with mental disorders treated in psychotherapeutic / rehabilitative clinics. Autoren T. Harfst 1 , C. Ghods 2 , M. M \u00f6 sko 2 , H.

METHOD This was a 7-week, open-label study evaluating 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 mg/day LDX in 318 children aged 6-12 years with ADHD. The ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) was the primary efficacy assessment. Secondary measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), Expression and Emotion Scale for Children (EESC), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, and electrocardiograms.   RESULTS At end point, mean (standard deviation [SD]) improvement from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total score was 28.6 (10.9) (p < 0.0001). Most subjects (89.9%) were rated \"improved\" (i.e., CGI-I 1 or 2). Improvements from baseline were observed in the EESC total and subscale scores (p < or = 0.0002). LDX treatment resulted in significant improvement on the Global Executive Composite, Behavioral Regulation, and Metacognition indices of the BRIEF (p < 0.0001). TEAEs (incidences > or =10%) were decreased appetite, decreased weight, irritability, insomnia, headache, upper abdominal pain, and initial insomnia.   CONCLUSIONS LDX was effective and generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with long-acting stimulant use.

DESIGN A multi-centred, randomised, controlled trial of four diets - Dr Atkins' New Diet Revolution, The Slim-Fast Plan, Weight Watchers Pure Points programme and Rosemary Conley's 'Eat yourself Slim' Diet and Fitness Plan - against a control diet, in parallel for 6 months.   SETTING AND SUBJECTS The trial was conducted at five universities across the UK (Surrey, Nottingham, Ulster (Coleraine), Bristol and Edinburgh (Queen Margaret University College)) and involved the participation of 300 overweight and obese males and females aged 21-60 years in a community setting.   RESULTS Significant weight loss was achieved by all dieting groups (5-9 kg at 6 months) but no significant difference was observed between diets at 6 months. The Weight Watchers and Rosemary Conley (low-fat) diets were followed by significant reductions in plasma LDL cholesterol (both -12.2 % after 6 months, P < 0.01), whereas the Atkins (low-carbohydrate) and Weight Watchers diets were followed by marked reductions in plasma TAG (-38.2 % and -22.6 % at 6 months respectively, P < 0.01). These latter two diets were associated with an increase in LDL particle size, a change that has been linked to reduced CVD risk.

The trial was designed as a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing memantine against a placebo in 60 patients with MS and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment was defined as the performance 1.5 standard deviations below the normative data in at least two tests of two cognitive domains in the Brief Repeatable Battery\u2013Neuropsychology.

The Physician's Health Study has accumulated 22 years of follow-up data, including 5 years of randomized data, from 22,071 apparently healthy men.   METHODS AND RESULTS At baseline and in yearly follow-up questionnaires, participants self-reported a history of diabetes, aspirin use, and various lifestyle factors. To evaluate the association between aspirin use and risk of subsequent diabetes, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying regression coefficients. During the 22 follow-up years, 1719 cases of diabetes were reported. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of developing diabetes was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.97) for those who self-selected any aspirin. During the 5 years of randomized treatment, 318 cases of diabetes were observed, with a hazard ratio of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.73-1.14) for those randomized to aspirin.   CONCLUSION Our data suggest a small but not significant decrease in the risk of diabetes during 5 years of randomized comparison of 325 mg of aspirin every other day.

RB was defined as SBP <or=90 with heart rate (HR) <or=90, and T was defined as SBP <or=90 with HR >90. Demographics, injury severity, mechanism, and outcomes were compared between the RB and T groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine significant risk factors for mortality.   RESULTS Of 130,906 adult trauma patients, 7,123 (5.4%) were hypotensive. After excluding patients dead on arrival and those with missing data, 3,727 patients were identified. RB was observed in 1,630 (44%) of patients, whereas T was observed in 2,097 patients (56%). RB patients were older (39.8 +/- 18.6 years vs. 35.3 +/- 17.0 years, p < 0.0001), less severely injured (injury severity score 18.0 +/- 14.2 vs. 20.5 +/- 15.3, p < 0.0001), more hypotensive (SBP 64.7 +/- 31.6 vs. 76.2 +/- 15.1, p < 0.0001), and had less abdominal trauma (abdomen abbreviated injury score 2.9 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.1, p < 0.0001) than their tachycardic counterparts. In addition, the mortality was significantly higher in the RB group compared with the T group (30.1% vs. 22.6%, p < 0.0001).

The objectives of this study were to externally validate the basic life support (BLS) termination of resuscitation, advanced life support (ALS) termination of resuscitation, and neurologic termination of resuscitation criteria and compare their abilities to predict survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.   METHODS This was a secondary analysis of the Denver Cardiac Arrest Registry. Consecutive adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest patients in Denver County from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004, were included in the study. The BLS termination of resuscitation, ALS termination of resuscitation, and neurologic termination of resuscitation criteria were applied to the cohort, and their predictive proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each set of criteria.   RESULTS Of the 715 patients included in this study, the median age was 65 years (interquartile range 52 to 78 years), and 69% were male patients. In addition, 223 (31%) had return of spontaneous circulation, 175 (24%) survived to hospital admission, 58 (8%) survived to hospital discharge, and 42 (6%) survived to hospital discharge with good neurologic function. The proportion of patients with good neurologic survival to hospital discharge correctly identified for continued resuscitation was 100% (95% CI 92% to 100%) for all 3 termination of resuscitation criteria. The proportion of patients with poor neurologic survival to hospital discharge or no survival to hospital discharge correctly identified as eligible for termination of resuscitation was 36% (95% CI 32% to 40%) with the BLS termination of resuscitation criteria, 25% (95% CI 22% to 29%) with the ALS termination of resuscitation criteria, and 6% (95% CI 4% to 8%) with the neurologic termination of resuscitation criteria. Use of the BLS termination of resuscitation criteria would have reduced transport of the largest number of patients.   CONCLUSION All 3 termination of resuscitation criteria had equally high abilities to identify patients requiring continued resuscitation.

Importantly, a significant additive genetic correlation (rG = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06\u20130.47) and bivariate heritability (h2=0.17, 95% CI: 0.08\u20130.27) was observed between migraine and endometriosis. Controlling for the personality trait neuroticism made little impact on this association. These results confirm the previously reported comorbidity between migraine and endometriosis and indicate common genetic influences completely explain their co\u2010occurrence within individuals. Given pharmacological treatments for endometriosis typically target hormonal pathways and a number of findings provide support for a relationship between hormonal variations and migraine, hormone\u2010related genes and pathways are highly plausible candidates for both migraine and endometriosis. Therefore, taking into account the status of both migraine and endometriosis may provide a novel opportunity to identify the genes underlying them. Finally, we propose that the analysis of such genetically correlated comorbid traits can increase power to detect genetic risk loci through the use of more specific, homogenous and heritable phenotypes.

An additional 52 patients (Group C) underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a hypofractionation schedule consisting of 56 Gy, delivered in 16 fractions (4/wk) of 3.5 Gy. Patients were followed for ART weekly during treatment. The overall treatment time, rectal dose-volume histograms, and ART status, defined as Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity, were used to determine the modified Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model parameters.

It has been reported as mild to moderate and its treatment may be inadequate. Infiltration of the surgical site with local anesthetics has provided transient benefit after craniotomy, but its effect on chronic pain has not been evaluated. Accordingly, we designed the present study to test the hypothesis that ropivacaine infiltration of the scalp reduces acute and persistent postoperative pain after intracranial tumor resection. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-blinded study. Inclusion criteria were intracranial tumor resection, age \u226518 or \u226480 yr, and ability to understand and use a visual analog scale (VAS). Exclusion criteria were history of craniotomy, chronic drug abuse, and neurologic disorders. All eligible patients were randomly included in Group I (infiltration) or C (control). Postoperative analgesia was IV acetaminophen combined with nalbuphine. At the end of the surgery, Group I received an infiltration of the surgical site with 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%. Acute pain was evaluated hourly by VAS during the first 24 h. The analgesic effect of ropivacaine was evaluated based on total consumption of nalbuphine and VAS scores. The incidence of persistent pain and neuropathic pain was assessed at the 2-mo postoperative evaluation. We used the Student\u2019s t-test to compare total nalbuphine consumption, repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni t-test for VAS score and the Fisher\u2019s exact test for chronic and neuropathic pain. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled, 25 in Group I and 27 in Group C. Demographic and intraoperative data were similar between groups. Group I showed a nonsignificant trend toward reduced nalbuphine consumption during the first postoperative day, 11.2 \u00b1 9.2 mg vs 16.6 \u00b1 11.0 mg for Group C (mean \u00b1 sd, P = 0.054).

One patient (4.1%) in Group I versus six (25%) patients in Group C (P = 0.04) experienced neuropathic pain. CONCLUSIONS: Because pain is moderate after intracranial tumor resection, there is limited interest in scalp infiltrations with ropivacaine in the acute postoperative period.

The subjects were scanned using the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]flumazenil ([11C]FMZ). Parametric voxel-by-voxel Logan plots were compared with methods based on regions of interest (ROI), to provide volume of distribution (VT) and binding potential (BPND) values. Plasma GABA levels were determined and a dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test was performed.ResultsIn MDD, parametric voxel-by-voxel Logan plots showed bilateral reduced [11C]FMZ binding in the parahippocampal gyrus and right lateral superior temporal gyrus (p uncorrected \u22640.001). In the temporal area, [11C]FMZ binding showed a strong inverse correlation with HPA axis activity. Plasma GABA did not discriminate MDD from controls, but correlated inversely with [11C]FMZ binding in the right insula. Following treatment with citalopram, voxel-based analysis revealed reduced binding in the right lateral temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.ConclusionThe bilateral reduction in limbic parahippocampal and right temporal [11C]FMZ binding found in MDD indicates decreased GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex affinity and/or number.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study.   PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Medical Department, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro, from July 2005 to March 2007.   METHODOLOGY Consecutive hepatitis C virus RNA positive and previously untreated patients were studied. Liver biopsy with histological evaluation and AST/ALT ratio, AST to platelet ratio index and FIB-4 were assessed in all patients. Receiver operative curves were developed.   RESULTS There were 158 patients (109 males, 49 females). On histological grounds non-advanced fibrosis (F0-1) was present in 74 (46.5%) of cases, whereas 84 (53.5%) patients had advanced (F2-4) fibrosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of APRI < 0.05-1 and FIB-4 < 1.45 were 0.7 and 0.74 respectively, which means that APRI < 1 and FIB-4 < 1.45 will exclude advanced fibrosis in 70% and 74% of patients respectively. An APRI of > 1 and FIB-4 will predict advanced fibrosis in 87% and 98% of patients respectively. AST/ALT ratio was inferior to both of these biomarkers.

The mechanisms linking symptoms of depression with disease progression in CHF are unclear. However, research studies have found evidence of alterations in immune activity associated with depression symptoms that may influence heart function. The present study sought to determine the relationship between depression symptoms and chemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in CHF patients, both at rest and in response to moderate exercise.   METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-five patients diagnosed with CHF (mean age, 59.8 +/- 14.5 years) and 45 non-CHF control subjects (mean age, 52.1 +/- 11.6) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before undergoing a moderate 20-minute bicycle exercise task. Chemotaxis of PBMCs was examined in vitro to a bacterial peptide f-met leu phe (fMLP) and a physiologic chemokine, stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) immediately before and after exercise. CHF patients had reduced chemotaxis to SDF-1 (P = .025) compared with non-CHF subjects. Higher BDI scores were associated with reduced baseline chemotaxis to SDF-1 in both CHF and non-CHF subjects (P = .027). In contrast, higher BDI scores were associated with increased chemotaxis to fMLP (P = .049) and SDF-1 (P = .018) in response to exercise in the CHF patients.   CONCLUSION The present study suggests a shift in immune cell mobility in CHF patients with greater depression symptom severity, with reduced chemotaxis to a physiologically specific chemokine at rest but increased chemotaxis to both nonspecific and specific chemical attractants in response to physical activity.

However quality and safety remains an issue of concern. Therefore, we evaluated minimal plasma concentrations and short-term safety of a generic lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg tablet formulation.   METHODS In a single-centre prospective pilot study, patients receiving protease-inhibitor-based antiretroviral treatment were switched to a generic lopinavir/ritonavir tablet at the standard dose (400/100 mg twice daily). Minimum drug concentrations (C(min)) of lopinavir and ritonavir were performed before switching (in 16 patients who were on Kaletra((R)) soft-gel capsules) and after 4 weeks (in all patients). Plasma levels of lopinavir and ritonavir were determined by a validated HPLC method. Either the Wilcoxon signed-rank or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the groups.   RESULTS A total of 37 patients (18 females) were included in the study. Two stopped their study medications prematurely because of intolerance. The median (interquartile range) lopinavir C(min) was 7.2 mg/l (5.8-8.3) and no patients had subtherapeutic levels <1.0 mg/l. No significant difference of lopinavir C(min) levels was found between Kaletra((R)), and the generic product (P=0.224). By contrast, the C(min) of generic ritonavir was higher (P=0.012).

METHODS AND RESULTS In 22 patients (10 male, mean age 65 +/- 6 years) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), a PVI during real-time PV spike registration and oesophageal temperature measurement was attempted. In 15 patients, a steerable sheath was used along with the HIFU-BC. In 67 of 83 PVs (81%), PVI was achieved exclusively using HIFU. Using the steerable sheath, the acute PVI rate rose from 50% (10/20 PVs) to 90% (57/63 PVs). In the latter, PVI was achieved with a single HIFU application in 60% (38/63 PVs) and mean sonication time of 11 +/- 7 s. The mean procedure time was 166 +/- 74 min including 58 +/- 25 min of HIFU-BC left atrial indwelling time. In four patients, peri-procedural complications occurred (one transient ischaemic attack, one phrenic nerve palsy, and two vascular access complications).

The expression of cell surface markers reflecting the differentiation stages of lymphocytes was measured using flow cytometry analyses performed on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

A selective depletion of peripherally expanded naive CD4+ T cells was found to be associated with HIV-1 infection but not with HIV-1 disease progression. Conclusions:The overall change during HIV-1 infection and progression is associated with a shift in the T-cell population toward an aged conformation, which may be further compromised by impaired renewal of the less-differentiated CD4+ T-cell population.

SETTING General practices, Scotland.   PARTICIPANTS GPs in 30 practices (n = 63) purposively selected to reflect a range of practice characteristics and levels of antidepressant prescribing.   METHOD Interviews with GPs were taped and transcribed. Analysis followed a Framework Approach.   RESULTS GPs offered a range of explanations for the rise in antidepressant prescribing in Scotland. Few doctors thought that the incidence of depression had increased, and many questioned the appropriateness of current levels of prescribing. A number of related factors were considered to have contributed to the increase. These included: the success of campaigns to raise awareness of depression; a willingness among patients to seek help; and the perceived safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, making it easier for GPs to manage depression in primary care. Many GPs believed that unhappiness, exacerbated by social deprivation and the breakdown of traditional social structures, was being 'medicalised' inappropriately.   CONCLUSION Most antidepressant prescriptions in Scotland are issued by GPs, and current policy aims to reduce levels of prescribing. To meet this aim, GPs' prescribing behaviour needs to change.

BACKGROUND LVAD therapy is an established treatment modality for patients with advanced heart failure. Pulsatile LVADs have limitations in design precluding their use for extended support. Continuous-flow rotary LVADs represent an innovative design with potential for small size and greater reliability by simplification of the pumping mechanism.   METHODS In a prospective, multicenter study, 281 patients urgently listed (United Network of Organ Sharing status 1A or 1B) for heart transplantation underwent implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD. Survival and transplantation rates were assessed at 18 months. Patients were assessed for adverse events throughout the study and for quality of life, functional status, and organ function for 6 months.   RESULTS Of 281 patients, 222 (79%) underwent transplantation, LVAD removal for cardiac recovery, or had ongoing LVAD support at 18-month follow-up. Actuarial survival on support was 72% (95% confidence interval: 65% to 79%) at 18 months. At 6 months, there were significant improvements in functional status and 6-min walk test (from 0% to 83% of patients in New York Heart Association functional class I or II and from 13% to 89% of patients completing a 6-min walk test) and in quality of life (mean values improved 41% with Minnesota Living With Heart Failure and 75% with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaires).

Patients were randomized 1:1 to an extended dosing schedule (EDS: darbepoetin alfa 300 \u03bcg Q2W if chemotherapy was QW, Q2W, or Q4W or darbepoetin alfa 500 \u03bcg Q3W if chemotherapy was Q3W) or weekly (150 \u03bcg QW regardless of chemotherapy schedule). Stratification factors included chemotherapy cycle length, screening hemoglobin (<10 g/dL vs. \u226510 g/dL), and tumor type (lung/gynecological vs. other nonmyeloid malignancies). The primary endpoint was change in hemoglobin from baseline to Week 13.ResultsSeven hundred fifty-two patients (374 QW patients; 378 EDS patients) received \u22651 dose of darbepoetin alfa and were included in the analysis. Demographics and disease state were similar between groups. Seventy-one percent of patients in the EDS group and 76% in the QW group achieved the target hemoglobin of \u226511.0 g/dL. There was a minimal difference in the primary endpoint of mean change in hemoglobin (baseline to Week 13) between the QW and the EDS groups (-0.04 g/dL; 95% confidence interval: -0.26, 0.17 g/dL). The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval was less than the prespecified limit of <0.75 g/dL, supporting noninferiority of the EDS dosing schedule.

This study investigated the reliability and usefulness of the F-Scan insole plantar pressure system in measuring possible postural control variables in a sample of 15 people post stroke. Method: A test-retest design was employed to measure contact pressure (CP), contact area (CA), center of force (COF) and its motion characteristics in four different stance positions. The data collection was repeated 30 minutes later to replicate the timing of a standard therapy period. Results: Good to excellent intertrial reliability was demonstrated (r = 0.704\u20130.986). The CP and CA data demonstrated relatively equal values between the hemi- and non-hemiparetic foot for the easier tasks (mean 3.6 to 3.7 KPa), and the asymmetry increased towards the non-hemiparetic foot as the tasks became harder (4 KPa vs. 3.3KPa on the hemiparetic). There were unexpected areas of high peak contact pressure on the more affected foot for several participants, whilst CA data quantified the expected redistribution of contact/weight toward the lateral border of the more affected foot in most, but not all, subjects.

Tolerability assessments included changes in liver enzymes and lipid levels from baseline to week 48. Efficacy assessments included changes in the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 and <400 copies/ml, and changes in CD4 cell count from baseline to week 48.Results:The analysis included 275 ART-na\u00efve and 179 pretreated but PI-na\u00efve patients. The proportion of ART-na\u00efve patients achieving <50 copies/ml by 48 weeks was 53.1% by intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 67.3% using last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis. In pretreated but PIna\u00efve patients, the proportions achieving <50 copies/ml by 48 weeks were 53.1% (ITT) and 70.4% (LOCF). The median increase in CD4 count at week 48 was +174 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR] 86, 265) in the ART-na\u00efve group and +100 cells/mm3 (IQR 0, 209) in the pretreated but PIna\u00efve group (p < 0.01 for both; LOCF).

We validated CBFMRI on quantitative CBF measurement by 15O-water positron emission tomography (CBFPET). Material and Methods\u2014 Comparative CBFMRI and CBFPET were performed in patients with acute and subacute stroke. In a voxel-based seed-growing technique, predefined CBFMRI thresholds (<40, <30, <20, <10 mL/100 g/min) were applied and the resulting volumes were compared with the hypoperfusion volume detected by the penumbral threshold (<20 mL/100 g/min) on CBFPET. The volumetric comparison was expressed as the C-ratio (volume CBFMRI/volume CBFPET) to identify the best MRI threshold. The influence of vessel pathology, hypoperfusion size, and time point of imaging was described. The proportion of voxels correctly classified as hypoperfused and the proportion of voxel correctly classified as nonhypoperfused of the best CBFMRI threshold was calculated and a Bland-Altman plot illustrated the method-specific differences. Results\u2014 In 24 patients (median time MRI to PET: 68 minutes; 16 patients imaged within 24 hours after stroke), the median volume of hypoperfusion <20 mL/100 g/min (CBFPET) was 78.5 cm3. Median hypoperfusion volume on CBFMRI ranged from 245.9 cm3 (<40 mL/100 g/min) to 35.5 cm3 (<10 mL/10 g/min). On visual inspection, an excellent qualitative congruence was found. The quantitative congruence was best for the MRI-CBF threshold <20 mL/100 g/min (median C-ratio: 1.0), reaching a proportion of voxels correctly classified as hypoperfused of 76% and a proportion of voxel correctly classified as nonhypoperfused of 96%, but a wide interindividual range (C-ratio 0.3 to 3.5) was found. Ipsilateral vessel pathology, time point of imaging, and size of hypoperfusion did not significantly influence the C-ratio. The Bland-Altman analysis for the volumetric difference of CBFMRI and CBFPET found a good overall agreement but a large SD. Conclusion\u2014 Hypoperfusion areas below the CBFPET penumbral threshold can be well identified by the CBFMRI threshold <20 mL/10 g/min at a group level, but a large individual variance (exceeding 20% of volume in nearly half of the patients) could not be explained.

PATIENTS AND METHODS The National Institutes of Health (NIH) -American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) diet and health study, a prospective cohort study, was used to validate the model. Men and women age 50 to 71 years at baseline answered self-administered questionnaires that asked about demographic characteristics, diet, lifestyle, and medical histories. We compared expected numbers of CRC patient cases predicted by the model to the observed numbers of CRC patient cases identified in the NIH-AARP study overall and in subgroups defined by risk factor combinations. The discriminatory power was measured by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).   RESULTS During an average of 6.9 years of follow-up, we identified 2,092 and 832 incident CRC patient cases in men and women, respectively. The overall expected/observed ratio was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.04) in men and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.11) in women. Agreement between the expected and the observed number of cases was good in most risk factor categories, except for in subgroups defined by CRC screening and polyp history.

The Dual Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator (DAVID) Trial found that patients with ventricular dysfunction and isolated sinus bradycardia (rate <60 with normal PR interval) had an unusually low incidence of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and mortality when paced infrequently.   OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to prospectively test our hypotheses that a similar benefit from bradycardia would be conferred in DAVID II as in DAVID but that this would be nullified by the faster heart rate achieved during atrial pacing in DAVID II.   METHODS Effects of atrial versus minimal ventricular pacing on outcome in defibrillator recipients with isolated bradycardia in DAVID II were prospectively evaluated.   RESULTS Ninety-eight DAVID II patients with isolated bradycardia were similar to 502 patients without it but had less baseline HF. HF medications were used comparably in both groups at baseline and throughout the study. Overall, patients with isolated bradycardia were less likely to die or be hospitalized for HF than others (12.2% vs. 26%; P = .01). There was no evidence that atrial pacing diminished this association. Adjusted for covariates, particularly baseline HF and its treatment, isolated bradycardia patients had substantially reduced risk for HF/death (P = .018) with or without atrial pacing (relative risk 0.47 and 0.71, respectively).   CONCLUSIONS Isolated bradycardia identifies patients at lower risk for HF and mortality, an association that is not necessarily negated by accelerating heart rate with atrial pacing.

DESIGN Animal preclinical study, prospective clinical trial.   SETTING Mainz University Clinic (tertiary care center). PATIENTS, METHODS, AND INTERVENTIONS: To establish the staining characteristics and optimal concentration of CV, the ileum and colon of 7 BL6 mice were stained with CV (0.1%-2%), and in vivo confocal imaging was performed with FIVE1. In a subsequent clinical trial, 67 sites in 36 patients were topically stained with CV 0.13%, and subsurface serial images were generated at different depths with an endomicroscope.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Prediction of histology according to the Mainz confocal classification and nuclear visualization with topical CV.   RESULTS Endomicroscopy with topical CV yielded (sub-)cellular details of normal mucosa, and regenerative and neoplastic changes at variable imaging depths in high resolution comparable to those with intravenous fluorescein. By cytoplasmic enrichment of CV, nuclear morphology could be negatively visualized. Reliable differentiation of nonneoplastic versus neoplastic changes during ongoing endoscopy and a high interobserver agreement based on the microscopic images generated in vivo could be achieved.   LIMITATIONS Single-center study, nonrandomized, limited number of patients.   CONCLUSIONS CV can be applied topically and allows simultaneous chromoendoscopy and endomicroscopy with accurate prediction of histology with visualization of nuclear morphology. It may therefore be a single-agent alternative to chromoendoscopy and fluorescein in endomicroscopy.", "1_year_count": 16, "label": 77}, {"paper_id": "a5b8f96591a93e007d860d91fad6a54003076b76", "text": "Neuromuscular disorders (NMD) are chronic devastating diseases. The aim of this multicenter cross-sectional study was to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of three NMDs in Germany. Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0107) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis (MG) or facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) were recruited consecutively in seven centers in Germany. The health-economic data were collected using a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach consisting of comprehensive questionnaires and patient diaries. Costs were evaluated from the societal perspective in 2009 Euros (EUR). Total annual costs from the societal perspective were EUR 36,380 (95% CI 27,090\u201347,970) per patient in ALS, EUR 26,240 (95% CI 17,770\u201337,940) in FSHD and EUR 14,950 (95% CI 10,470\u201321,730) in MG. The main components of costs were the expenditures of health insurance and the loss of productivity of patients and their caregivers. The following independent cost-driving factors were identified: disease severity, assistance in activities of daily living (ADL), dementia and younger age in ALS, disease severity in FSHD and assistance in ADL, disease severity and assistance in ADL in MG. The socioeconomic burden of NMDs in Germany is considerable. Further studies evaluating both the health-economic and clinical effects of NMD treatment as well as disease management programs and benchmarking activities are necessary.", "1_year_count": 4, "label": 50}, {"paper_id": "882a235099f8e6c36e06dd9415e53054116b92d3", "text": "We previously demonstrated that safflower seed extract (SSE) and its major antioxidant constituents, serotonin hydroxycinnamic acid amides, suppressed LDL oxidation in vitro, decreased plasma autoantibody titres to oxidized LDL and attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in apoE-deficient mice. In this report, we examined whether SSE, rich in serotonin derivatives, could affect markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and aortic stiffness in healthy human subjects. Twenty Japanese male volunteers were studied at baseline, after 2.1 g SSE supplementation daily (providing 290 mg serotonin derivatives/d) for 4 weeks, and after a 4-week washout period. Significant reductions in circulating oxidized LDL, autoantibody titres to malondialdehyde-modified LDL, the soluble form of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and urinary 8-isoprostane were observed after a 4-week intervention. Although there were no statistically significant differences in blood pressure or brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), an index of arterial stiffness, baPWV was lower than baseline in eleven of twenty subjects and was accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure. Statistically significant negative correlations were observed between the extent of initial cardiovascular risk markers (autoantibody titres, 8-isoprostane, sVCAM-1 and baPWV) and the effect of intervention. This suggested that individuals with elevated oxidative stress, inflammation, and/or arterial stiffness may receive more benefit from SSE supplementation.", "1_year_count": 6, "label": 32}]
