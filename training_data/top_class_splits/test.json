The men completed a validated dietary questionnaire and a questionnaire on general background characteristics (including smoking habits) at baseline. Incident cases of cancer were identified through the national Finnish Cancer Registry.ResultsDuring an average 10.2\u00a0year follow-up, 1,703 lung cancers, 799 prostate cancers, 365 urothelial cancers, 316 colorectal cancers, 224 stomach cancers, 192 pancreatic cancers, 184 renal cell cancers, and 175 lymphomas were diagnosed. Dietary acrylamide intake was positively associated with the risk of lung cancer; relative risk (RR) in the highest versus the lowest quintile in the multivariable-adjusted model was 1.18 ((95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01\u20131.38, p for trend 0.11).

The effects of a novel high molecular weight GS extract, Om Santal Adivasi, (OSA\u00ae) on plasma insulin, C\u2010peptide and glucose in a small cohort of patients with T2DM are reported here. Oral administration of OSA\u00ae (1\u2009g/day, 60 days) induced significant increases in circulating insulin and C\u2010peptide, which were associated with significant reductions in fasting and post\u2010prandial blood glucose. In vitro measurements using isolated human islets of Langerhans demonstrated direct stimulatory effects of OSA\u00ae on insulin secretion from human ?\u2010cells, consistent with an in vivo mode of action through enhancing insulin secretion.

METHODS Population pharmacokinetic modelling (using NONMEM) was performed with total and unbound concentration-time data from 100 patients (36-73 years) who had received a median 192 mg m(-2) melphalan dose. Model derived estimates of total and unbound melphalan exposure (AUC) in patients with serious melphalan toxicity and those who had a good disease response (>or=90% decrease in paraprotein concentrations) were compared using the Mann-Whitney test.   RESULTS A two compartment model generated population mean estimates for total and unbound melphalan clearance (CL) of 27.8 and 128 l h(-1), respectively. Estimated creatinine clearance, fat free mass and haematocrit were important determinants of total and unbound CL, reducing the inter-individual variability in total CL from 34% to 27% and in unbound CL from 42% to 30%. Total AUC (range 4.9-24.4 mg l(-1) h) and unbound AUC (range 1.0-6.5 mg l(-1) h) were significantly higher in patients who had oral mucositis (>or=grade 3) and long hospital admissions (P < 0.01). Patients who responded well had significantly higher unbound AUC (median 3.2 vs. 2.8 mg l(-1) h, P < 0.05) when assessed from diagnosis to post-melphalan and higher total AUC (median 21.3 vs. 13.4 mg l(-1) h, P= 0.06), when assessed from pre- to post-melphalan.

The usefulness of chest tube clearance is discussed controversially. Therefore, we investigated the impact of postoperative chest tube milking on postoperative outcome in a prospective, randomised trial.   METHODS Within a period of 11 months, 145 patients undergoing pulmonary resection through thoracotomy were included in the study. Two chest tubes each (silicone drainage, Redax, Mirandola, Italy) were placed in all patients (ventral tube 21Ch and dorsal tube 24Ch). Milking was applied to both chest tubes for 1 min every 2h within the first 48 h postoperatively and continuous suction of -20 cm H(2)O was maintained for 48 h. Duration of chest tube drainage, quantity and quality of effusion or air leakage, co-morbidity, length of hospital stay and 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were analysed. Furthermore, outcome was measured by assessment of chest radiographs at the time of discharge from hospital.   RESULTS Randomisation resulted in milking of chest tubes of 73 patients and in observation of chest tubes without any manipulation in 72 patients. Twenty-one patients had to be excluded from further analysis due to violation from the study protocol (n=9), necessity of replacement of a chest tubes (n=9) and re-operation for bleeding (n=3). The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4% in each group and the 30-day morbidity was 49.3% in the milking group and 52.8% in the observation group. Milking of chest tubes was not associated with a lower postoperative mortality or morbidity (p=0.99 and p=0.67, respectively; chi-square test). We observed a significant increase of postoperative pleural effusion drainage in the milking group 48 h after surgery (p=0.004; unpaired t-test). No correlation was seen between milking of chest tubes and the duration of chest tube drainage, quality of effusion, air leakage or length of hospitalisation.   CONCLUSIONS We showed for the first time that postoperative chest tube milking is associated with a significant increase of pleural fluid drainage. Postoperative morbidity and mortality was not improved and therefore chest tube milking cannot be recommended as a routine postoperative procedure.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "e6899bea789e339a32affe633d638b0f242e6a34", "text": "The analysis of a flow pattern in cerebral aneurysms and the effect of stent strut shapes are presented in this article. The treatment of cerebral aneurisms with a porous stent has recently been proposed as a minimally invasive way to prevent rupture and favor coagulation mechanism inside the aneurism. The efficiency of stent is related to several parameters, including porosity and stent strut shapes. The goal of this article is to study the effect of the stent strut shape and porosity on the hemodynamic properties of the flow inside an aneurysm using a numerical analysis. In this study, we use the concept of flow reduction to characterize the stent efficiency. Also, we use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) of a non-Newtonian blood flow. To resolve the characteristics of a highly complex flow, we use an extrapolation method for the wall and stent boundary. To ease the code development and facilitate the incorporation of new physics, a scientific programming strategy based on object-oriented concepts is developed. Reduced velocity, smaller average vorticity magnitude, smaller average shear rate, and increased viscosity are observed when the proposed stent shapes and porosities are used. The rectangular stent is observed to be optimal and to decrease the magnitude of the velocity by 89.25% in the 2D model and 53.92% in the 3D model in the aneurysm sac.

To determine the test-retest reliability and the discriminative validity of the new Fly method. Summary of Background Data. A lack of reliable and valid measures for grading the deficits of movement control in the cervical spine makes it impossible to prescribe treatment appropriate to each patient's respective impairment level. Methods. Head tracking of a moving fly which appeared on a computer screen. Easy, medium, and difficult patterns, each of which was repeated 3 times in random order, were tested. Amplitude accuracy (deviation of movements), directional accuracy (time on target, undershoots vs. overshoots) were compared across patterns and groups on 2 occasions, 1 week apart. Results. The intraclass correlation coefficient2,1 ranged from 0.53 to 0.82 for both variables, except for the subvariable \u201covershoots\u201d (0.14\u20130.42).

However, the long-term effects of such diets are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether high-protein diets are superior to high-carbohydrate diets for improving glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.MethodsOverweight/obese individuals (BMI 27\u201340\u00a0kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6.5\u201310%) were recruited for a 12\u00a0month, parallel design, dietary intervention trial conducted at a diabetes specialist clinic (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Of the 108 initially randomised, 99 received advice to follow low-fat (30% total energy) diets that were either high in protein (30% total energy, n\u2009=\u200953) or high in carbohydrate (55% total energy, n\u2009=\u200946). Dietary assignment was done by a third party using computer-generated random numbers. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included changes in weight, lipids, blood pressure, renal function and calcium loss. Study endpoints were assessed blinded to the diet group, but the statistical analysis was performed unblinded. This study used an intention-to-treat model for all participants who received dietary advice. Follow-up visits were encouraged regardless of dietary adherence and last measurements were carried forward for study non-completers.ResultsNinety-nine individuals were included in the analysis (53 in high protein group, 46 in high carbohydrate group). HbA1c decreased in both groups over time, with no significant difference between groups (mean difference of the change at 12\u00a0months; 0.04 [95% CI \u22120.37, 0.46]; p\u2009=\u20090.44).

Methods Pts received bryostatin 45\u00a0mcg/m2 as a 72\u00a0h continuous infusion followed by cisplatin 50\u00a0mg/m2. Cycles were repeated every 3\u00a0weeks. Dosages were chosen based on phase I data obtained by the CCC in a population of pts with mixed tumor types. Results Eight pts with recurrent or persistent epithelial OC received 23 cycles of treatment. All pts had received previous platinum-based chemotherapy; two pts had received one prior course, five had received two prior courses, and one had received three prior courses of chemotherapy. The median age was 64 (range 32\u201372), and Karnofsky performance status 90 (range 80\u2013100). A median of 3 cycles of chemotherapy were delivered (range: 1\u20135). The median progression-free and overall survivals were 3 and 8.2\u00a0months respectively. Best responses included two partial responses (one in a platinum-resistant pt), three pts with stable disease, and three progressions. All pts experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicities including severe myalgias/pain/fatigue/asthenia in six pts, and severe nausea/vomiting/constipation in two other pts. One pt experienced a seizure and liver function tests were elevated in one other. Conclusions A modest response rate is observed in pts with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer treated with the combination of bryostatin and cisplatin. The toxicity profile, however, observed in this pt population (primarily severe myalgias), precludes tolerability and prevents this combination from further investigation at this dose and schedule.

The P-group received a 0.8\u00a0mg/kg induction dose and a 3\u00a0mg/kg/h maintenance dose of 1% propofol using an infusion pump. All patients received 15\u00a0mg pentazocine at the start of the ESD and at 60-min intervals thereafter. We recorded and analyzed blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate during and following the procedure and evaluated post-anesthetic recovery scores (PARS) and subsequent alertness scores.ResultsThe propofol maintenance and total dose amounts were (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) 3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0mg/kg/h and 395\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0202\u00a0mg, respectively.

Experimental Design: Part A of the study followed a multiple-ascending dose design to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of saracatinib. Part B was a randomized, parallel-group, cohort-expansion phase to further assess tolerated doses. Safety, tolerability, and Src activity (immunohistochemistry and lysate-based methodologies) were assessed after 21 days of once-daily oral dosing. PK was assessed after single and multiple dosing.

Although the prevalence of urine leaks ranges from 4.5% to 7.5% at high-volume RALP centers, urine leaks prolong catheterization and may lead to ileus, peritonitis, and require intervention. Barbed polyglyconate sutures maintain running suture line tension and may be advantageous in RALP anastomosis for reducing this complication.   OBJECTIVE To compare barbed polyglyconate and polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) running sutures for RALP anastomosis.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-surgeon study comparing RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate (n = 45) or polyglactin 910 (n = 36) sutures.   SURGICAL PROCEDURE RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate or polyglactin 910 sutures was studied.   MEASUREMENTS Operative time, cost differential, perioperative complications, and cystogram contrast extravasation by anastomosis suture type were measured.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Although baseline characteristics and overall operative times were similar, barbed polyglyconate sutures were associated with shorter mean anastomosis times of 9.7 min versus 9.8 min (p = 0.014). In addition, anastomosis with barbed polyglyconate rather than polyglactin 910 sutures was associated with more frequent cystogram extravasation 8 d postoperatively (20.0% vs 2.8%; p = 0.019), longer mean catheterization times (11.1 d vs 8.3 d; p = 0.048), and greater suture costs per case ($51.52 vs $8.44; p < 0.001). After 8 of 29 (27.6%) barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites demonstrated postoperative day 8 cystogram extravasation, we modified our technique to avoid overtightening, reducing cystogram extravasation to 1 (6.3%) of 16 subsequent barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites.

For older patients, several designs of Total Hip Arthroplasty have shown excellent results in terms of both function and value for money. However, in younger more active patients, there is approximately a 50% failure rate at 25 years for traditional implants. Hip resurfacing is a relatively new arthroplasty technique. In a recent review of the literature on resurfacing arthroplasty it was concluded that the short-term functional results appear promising but some potential early disadvantages were identified, including the risk of femoral neck fracture and collapse of the head of the femur.The aim of the current study is to assess whether there is a difference in functional hip scores at one year post-operation between Total Hip Arthroplasty and Resurfacing Arthroplasty. Secondary aims include assessment of complication rates for both procedures as well cost effectiveness.Methods/designAll patients medically fit for surgery and deemed suitable for a resurfacing arthroplasty are eligible to take part in this study. A randomisation sequence will be produced and administered independently. After consenting, all patients will be clinically reviewed and hip function, quality of life and physical activity level will be assessed through questionnaires. The allocated surgery will then be performed with the preferred technique of the surgeon. Six weeks post-operation hip function will be assessed and complications recorded. Three, six and 12 months post-operation hip function, quality of life and physical activity level will be assessed.

The aims were to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of saracatinib when combined with gemcitabine, and assess the efficacy of this combination in advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods Eligibility criteria included locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and no prior chemotherapy. In phase I saracatinib was escalated in combination with gemcitabine (1000\u00a0mg/m2) to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The study was then expanded to a single arm phase II trial using a Simon 2-stage design. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response (OR) plus stable disease \u22654\u00a0months (SD4) rate; if \u22658 patients had OR+SD4, the study would proceed to stage 2. Results Thirteen patients were enrolled into the phase I portion of this study. Saracatinib 175\u00a0mg PO daily was chosen as the RP2D in combination with gemcitabine. Twenty-one additional patients were then enrolled at the RP2D (phase II). Of the 22 response evaluable patients treated at the RP2D, 9 patients (40.9%) had progressive disease, 6 patients (27.3%) had stable disease for less than 4\u00a0months, 5 patients (22.7%) had SD4, and 2 patients (9.1%) had a partial response to treatment. Objective criteria for continuing to stage 2 were thus not met and the trial was closed following the accrual of 34 patients.

Each intervention PCP was assigned 12 simulated type 2 diabetes cases that took about 15 min each to complete. Cases were designed to remedy specific physician deficits found in their electronic medical record observed practice patterns. General linear mixed models that accommodated the cluster randomized study design were used to assess patient-level change from preintervention to 12-month postintervention of A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.

DESIGN Prospective, randomized, open-label study.   SETTING Academic medical center.   PATIENTS Fifty patients undergoing elective colonoscopy.   INTERVENTION PCS or AAS using PR. All patients breathed 100% oxygen via an anesthesia mask with continuous spirometry and bispectral index (BIS).   MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Respiratory rate and BIS.   RESULTS Colonoscopy was completed in all patients. No patient under PCS required airway rescue. Five patients under AAS required bag-mask ventilation to resolve Sao(2) (arterial oxygen saturation) less than 90% lasting longer than 30 seconds. The median BIS for the AAS group was 71.7 (range 61.06-82.34) and 88.1 (range 83.15-93.05) for the PCS group. Median respiratory rates were 5.97 (range 1.21-10.73) breaths per minute for AAS and 13.19 (range 9.54-16.84) for PCS. Respiratory rates less than 2 breaths per minute composed 28% of the procedure time for AAS, but only 5% for PCS.

Experimental Design: Enrolled patients were limited to those who did not achieve a very good partial remission (VGPR) following one or more induction regimens, and were randomized to receive a single escalating dose of bortezomib (1.0, 1.3, or 1.6 mg/m2) either 24 hours before or 24 hours after high-dose melphalan. Dose escalation was based on the escalation with overdose control (EWOC), a Bayesian statistical model. Bone marrow aspirates were collected before initiation of therapy and at the time of transplant to evaluate which sequence resulted in maximal plasma cell apoptosis, and response to transplant was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Results: Among 39 randomized patients, 20 received bortezomib after melphalan and 19 received bortezomib before melphalan. Toxicities and posttransplant hematopoietic recovery rates were similar between arms. The overall response rate for all patients was 87%, with 51% achieving a VGPR or better. Pharmacodynamic studies showed greater plasma cell apoptosis among patients who received bortezomib following melphalan. Conclusions: The use of bortezomib in conjunction with high-dose melphalan is safe, with data suggesting improved efficacy. A single dose of bortezomib administered after high-dose melphalan is the recommended dose and schedule for future clinical investigation.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition also prevents the breakdown of the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y and, when angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is inhibited, substance P. This study tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition would enhance the blood pressure response to acute ACE inhibition. Subjects with the metabolic syndrome were treated with 0 mg of enalapril (n=9), 5 mg of enalapril (n=8), or 10 mg enalapril (n=7) after treatment with sitagliptin (100 mg/day for 5 days and matching placebo for 5 days) in a randomized, cross-over fashion.

Enalapril decreased ACE activity in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). Sitagliptin lowered blood pressure during enalapril (0 mg; P=0.02) and augmented the hypotensive response to 5 mg of enalapril (P=0.05). In contrast, sitagliptin attenuated the hypotensive response to 10 mg of enalapril (P=0.02). During sitagliptin, but not during placebo, 10 mg of enalapril significantly increased heart rate and plasma norepinephrine concentrations. There was no effect of 0 or 5 mg of enalapril on heart rate or norepinephrine after treatment with either sitagliptin or placebo. Sitagliptin enhanced the dose-dependent effect of enalapril on renal blood flow. In summary, sitagliptin lowers blood pressure during placebo or submaximal ACE inhibition; sitagliptin activates the sympathetic nervous system to diminish hypotension when ACE is maximally inhibited.

Platelet function was measured serially by light transmission aggregometry (adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid [AA] were used as agonists) and assessment of the phosphorylation status of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein at baseline, 12 h, 3 to 5 days, and 30 days after randomization.   RESULTS The P2Y(12) reactivity index was significantly lower, by 22.2%, after 1 month of treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with placebo when used in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (p = 0.020). Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 5 and 20 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate was lower by 13.3% (p = 0.026) and 9.8% (p = 0.029), respectively, after 1 month of treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with placebo. Platelet aggregation after AA stimulation was low and did not change significantly throughout the study. There were no cases of aspirin resistance during follow-up that was suggestive of good compliance with the medication.

Although several candidate gene polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relatively few studies have assessed the ability of T2DM candidate genes to assess the risk of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM beyond the information provided by clinical risk factors. Objective. To test whether the inclusion of genetic markers in a regression model provides a better assessment of the risk of IFG, IGT, and T2DM than a model based only on non-genetic risk factors commonly assessed in clinical settings. Methods. Subjects (n = 485; 213 parents, 272 offspring) from the Quebec Family Study, not known to haveT2DM, were measured for several risk factors and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Thirty-eight SNPs in 25 susceptibility/ candidate genes previously reported to be associated with T2DM were genotyped. In order to identify risk factors associated with IFG/IGT/T2DM, two logistic regression models were tested: a full model (FM) including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, and the 38 SNPs; and a reduced model (RM), in which the SNPs were dropped, which allowed us to test the null-hypothesis that the markers are not associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Performances of the models were compared by using a likelihood ratio test and the receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC).The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from the ROC curve. Results. The analyses showed that age (P < 0.0001), BMI (P < 0.0001), and six variants (IGF2BP2 rs4402960, P = 0.002; ADIPOQ+276 G>T, P = 0.004; UCP2Ala55Val, P = 0.01; CDKN2AI2B rs3731201, P = 0.02; rs495490, P = 0.02, and rsl 0811661, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Dropping genetic markers from the analysis significantly reduced the fit of the model to the data (chi-square = 38.98, P < 0.00001 contrasting RM to FM), suggesting that the genetic markers are significantly associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Furthermore, the AUC was higher for FM than for RM (0.85 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.89) versus 0.81 (95% CI 0.76\u20130.85), P = 0.004). Conclusion.

In addition, compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded to evaluate activation of the vagus nerve in response to VNS.   METHODS Three patients were implanted with a cuff-electrode around the left vagus nerve, that was connected to a rechargeable pulse generator under the left clavicula. Two weeks after surgery, therapeutic VNS (0.25-1.25 mA, 500 \u03bcs, 30s on, 10 min off and 30Hz) was initiated and stimulus-induced CAPs were recorded.   RESULTS The ADNS-300 system was successfully implanted in all three patients and patients were appropriately stimulated during six months of follow-up.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients undergoing a repeat operation or further mastectomy within 6 months of random assignment, or a pathologically avoidable mastectomy at initial operation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, ISRCTN number 57474502.   FINDINGS 816 patients were randomly assigned to MRI and 807 to no MRI. Addition of MRI to conventional triple assessment was not significantly associated with reduced a reoperation rate, with 153 (19%) needing reoperation in the MRI group versus 156 (19%) in the no MRI group, (odds ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.75-1.24; p=0.77).   INTERPRETATION Our findings are of benefit to the NHS because they show that MRI might be unnecessary in this population of patients to reduce repeat operation rates, and could assist in improved use of NHS services.

METHOD Sixty-three adolescents (12-18 years of age) participated in a clinical trial examining the effectiveness of IPT-A (Mufson, Dorta, Wickramaratne, et al., 2004). The sample was 84.1% female and 15.9% male (mean age = 14.67 years). Adolescents were 74.6% Latino, 14.3% African American, 1.6% Asian American, and 9.5% other. They came primarily from low-income families. Adolescents were randomly assigned to receive IPT-A or TAU delivered by school-based mental health clinicians. Assessments, completed at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 (or at early termination), included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1967), the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (Robin & Foster, 1989), and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report (Weissman & Bothwell, 1976).   RESULTS Multilevel modeling indicated that treatment condition interacted with adolescents' baseline reports of conflict with their mothers and social dysfunction with friends to predict the trajectory of adolescents' depressive symptoms over the course of treatment, controlling for baseline levels of depression. The benefits of IPT-A over TAU were particularly strong for the adolescents who reported high levels of conflict with their mothers and social dysfunction with friends.

SETTING Ten general practices in North Central London.   METHOD Fourteen patients and their GPs were interviewed using the taped-assisted recall (TAR) method, and asked how understanding of the patients' mental health problems had been discussed in a recent consultation. The resulting 42 transcripts of the GP-patient consultations and separate GP and patient TAR interviews were analysed using qualitative thematic and process analytic methods.   RESULTS Patients considered understanding their mental health problems to be important, and half reported their GP consultations as helpful in this respect. The process of coming to an understanding was predominantly patient-led. Patients suggested their own explanations, and these were facilitated and focused by the doctors' questioning, listening, validating, and elaborating aspects they considered important. Both doctors and patients experienced constraints on the extent to which developing understanding of problems was possible in GP consultations.

Neurobehavioral performance, alertness, and sleep were studied in young healthy participants (N=18) who underwent a 25-day forced desynchrony protocol in which the period of the sleep-wakefulness cycle was scheduled to be 42.85\u2009h (duration of each wakefulness episode: 28.57\u2009h; sleep/rest episode: 14.28\u2009h).

Treatment with modafinil significantly attenuated the performance decrements seen for several parameters including cognitive-psychomotor speed, visual attention and reaction times both with progressive hours awake and when working at adverse circadian phases. Subjective alertness and sleep parameters were similar between treatment groups, but modafinil-treated participants had fewer bouts of inadvertent sleep during scheduled waking. Modafinil reduced the neurobehavioral impairment associated with work, both during prolonged wakefulness and at adverse circadian phases, without adversely affecting subjective alertness or subsequent sleep.

BACKGROUND Identifying patients with acute STEMI who experience adverse remodeling and develop left ventricular dysfunction 3 months post-MI is a priority for guiding subsequent therapy.   METHODS The Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial tested pexelizumab treatment in STEMI patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset who were to undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We studied 64 patients within this trial according to a prespecified substudy that included paired core laboratory delayed-enhancement CMR at days 3 and 90 as well as plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; in picograms per milliliter) measured at randomization and 24 hours. A multivariable model predicting day 90 left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was developed from clinical, biomarker, and imaging findings.   RESULTS Patients had a median age of 60 years (52-68), 89% were male, and 60% had anterior STEMI. Time from symptom onset to percutaneous coronary intervention was 3 hours. The median baseline LVEF was 48% (38%-56%) and was 50% (40%-54%) at 90 days: 7 patients (11%) had an LVEF <35% at 90 days. Patients with a lower 90-day LVEF (as a continuous variable) had a higher 24-hour NT-proBNP (P = .02) and a larger baseline infarct size by CMR (median 15% LV [8%-20% LV]) (P < .01). Microvascular obstruction (no reflow) was greater as measured by CMR (median 2.8% [1.4%-6.1%]) in patients with a lower 90-day LVEF (P < .01). Median baseline and 24-hour NT-proBNP levels were 94 pg/mL (54-292 pg/mL) and 1,448 pg/mL (958-2,599 pg/mL), respectively. In a multivariable model with clinical, biomarker, and imaging variables, only 3 variables independently predicted 90-day LVEF: 24-hour NT-proBNP, baseline CMR infarct size, and microvascular obstruction.   CONCLUSIONS Three key pathophysiologic variables of the post-STEMI myocardium measuring baseline infarct size and the extent of microvascular obstruction on CMR and wall tension (24-hour NT-proBNP) independently predicted 90-day LVEF.

There has been a move recently toward the use of phenylephrine as a vasopressor infusion to improve maternal cardiovascular stability and fetal outcome. Although it seems safe in the elective setting, there have been concerns about its propensity for causing an increase in afterload and a baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia in the mother, with a consequent reduction in maternal cardiac output (CO). Using a noninvasive measure of CO, our aim was to investigate whether there were any dose-dependent effects of phenylephrine on maternal cardiovascular stability and, if so, any impact on fetal outcome. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, 75 women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were allocated to receive a phenylephrine infusion at 25 &mgr;g/min, 50 &mgr;g/min, or 100 &mgr;g/min. This infusion was titrated to maintain maternal baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), from induction of spinal anesthesia until delivery. The maternal cardiovascular variables recorded included heart rate (HR) and SBP. A suprasternal Doppler monitor measured CO and stroke volume, as well as measures of venous return (corrected flow time) and contractility, at baseline, and then every 5 minutes for 20 minutes after initiation of spinal anesthesia. Apgar scores and umbilical cord blood gases were recorded. RESULTS: SBP control was satisfactory in all groups; however, the group receiving phenylephrine 100 &mgr;g/min required significantly higher doses to achieve arterial blood pressure control compared with the lower infusion rates. There were no significant differences in the number of times SBP decreased below 80% of baseline, or the numbers of boluses of ephedrine or phenylephrine required to maintain SBP above 80% of baseline. There were significant time and dose-dependent reductions in HR and CO with phenylephrine, such that HR and CO were seen to decrease with time in each group, and also with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine. Stroke volume remained stable throughout. Apgar scores and umbilical cord blood gases were similar among groups. CONCLUSION: By infusing a higher concentration (100 &mgr;g/min), we subject the mother and fetus to a much higher dose of phenylephrine, with significant effects on maternal HR and CO (up to a 20% reduction). Future investigation is required to determine whether this reduction in maternal CO has detrimental effects when providing anesthesia for an emergency cesarean delivery for a compromised fetus.", "1_year_count": 5, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "1f942c0bbdd4be18b1ed53ef0a812b75cbab20b1", "text": "OBJECTIVE To longitudinally estimate the change in glycosaminoglycan content of knee cartilage in asymptomatic untrained female novice runners participating in a Start To Run program (STR) compared to sedentary controls.   METHOD Nine females enrolling in a 10-week STR and 10 sedentary controls participated voluntarily. Prior to and after the 10-week period, both groups were subjected to dGEMRIC imaging. dGEMRIC indices of knee cartilage were determined at baseline and for the change after the 10-week period in both groups. Based on a self-reported weekly log, physical activity change during the study was depicted as decreased, unchanged or increased. The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied to test the hypotheses that dGEMRIC changes occurred between groups and according to physical activity changes respectively.   RESULTS No significant differences were established between groups for dGEMRIC indices at baseline (P=0.541). A significant positive change of the median dGEMRIC index in the runners group was demonstrated when compared to the controls [+11.66ms (95% CI: -25.29, 44.43) vs -9.56ms (95% CI: -29.55, 5.83), P=0.006]. The change in dGEMRIC index differed significantly according to physical activity change (P=0.014), showing an increase in dGEMRIC index with increasing physical activity.

The aim of the study was to determine whether a high dose of atorvastatin lowers blood pressure (BP) in normolipemic patients with well controlled primary arterial hypertension and if this effect is associated with alteration of biomarkers of endothelial function and oxidative stress. In this open-label study, normolipemic patients (n=56) were randomized in the proportion of 2:1 to receive atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 3 months (statin-treated, ST n=39), or to previous therapy (statin-free, SF). BP was measured using a 24-h ambulatory BP measurement device. Plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1\u03b1 (prostacyclin metabolite), serum nitric oxide (NO) and levels of autoantibodies immunoglobulin G against oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were measured. Major findings. The mean change in systolic BP and diastolic BP for ST was \u2013 5.7 mmHg (95% CI \u20134.1 to \u20137.2 mmHg) and \u20133.9 mmHg (95% CI \u20132.7 to \u20135.0 mmHg), respectively. Hypotensive statin effect was independent of lipid lowering. No change of BP in SF patients was observed. In ST, prostacyclin metabolites and NO concentrations were not significantly increased and autoantibodies against ox-LDL concentrations did not change. In ST, the decrease in BP correlated with increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL. Principal conclusion. High-dose atorvastatin resulted in reduction of BP independently of lipid-lowering effect, changes in endothelial function and oxidative stress, but it was related to the increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL.

SAG overexpression inhibits apoptosis induced by many stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. SAG mRNA was overexpressed in human lung tumor tissues with a correlation to poor patient survival. To investigate whether SAG serves as an anticancer target, we determined the effect of SAG silencing on cell proliferation, survival, and radiosensitivity. Experimental Design: SAG protein expression in human tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining using tumor tissue arrays. SAG expression in cancer cells was knocked down by siRNA silencing. The anticancer effects of SAG silencing were evaluated by in vitro assays for cell growth and survival and by an in vivo orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Radiosensitization by SAG silencing of human cancer cells was determined by clonogenic survival assay. Apoptosis induction was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, caspase-3 activation assay, and Western blotting of apoptosis-associated proteins. Results: SAG was overexpressed in multiple human tumor tissues compared with their normal counterparts. SAG silencing selectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation, suppressed in vivo tumor growth, and sensitized radiation-resistant cancer cells to radiation. Mechanistically, SAG silencing induced apoptosis with accumulation of NOXA, whereas SAG overexpression reduced NOXA levels and shortened NOXA protein half-life. Conclusions: The findings showed that SAG E3 ubiquitin ligase plays an essential role in cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth and may serve as a promising anticancer and radiosensitizing target.

It is a serious health problem in Japan as well. Lifestyle interventions can reduce progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes, and glycemic control has been shown to improve postprandial plasma glucose levels. Moreover, several studies have suggested that continuous interventions (combined diet and exercise) can improve the plasma glucose level and reduce dosage of hypoglycemic agents.Although many interventional studies of lifestyle education for persons with diabetes in hospitals have been reported, only a few have been clinic-based studies employing an evidence-based lifestyle education program. This article describes the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of lifestyle education for patients with type 2 diabetes in clinics by registered dietitians.Methods/DesignIn Japan, general practitioners generally have their own medical clinics to provide medical care for outpatients in the community, including those with type 2 diabetes. With the collaboration of such general practitioners, the study patients were enrolled in the present study. Twenty general practitioners were randomly allocated to each provide patients for entry into either an intervention group (10) or a control group (10).

However, most patients with KRAS wild-type tumours still do not respond. We studied the effect of other downstream mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the pre-KRAS selection era.   METHODS 1022 tumour DNA samples (73 from fresh-frozen and 949 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue) from patients treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008 were gathered from 11 centres in seven European countries. 773 primary tumour samples had sufficient quality DNA and were included in mutation frequency analyses; mass spectrometry genotyping of tumour samples for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA was done centrally. We analysed objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival in molecularly defined subgroups of the 649 chemotherapy-refractory patients treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy.   FINDINGS 40.0% (299/747) of the tumours harboured a KRAS mutation, 14.5% (108/743) harboured a PIK3CA mutation (of which 68.5% [74/108] were located in exon 9 and 20.4% [22/108] in exon 20), 4.7% (36/761) harboured a BRAF mutation, and 2.6% (17/644) harboured an NRAS mutation. KRAS mutants did not derive benefit compared with wild types, with a response rate of 6.7% (17/253) versus 35.8% (126/352; odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.22; p<0.0001), a median PFS of 12 weeks versus 24 weeks (hazard ratio [HR] 1.98, 1.66-2.36; p<0.0001), and a median overall survival of 32 weeks versus 50 weeks (1.75, 1.47-2.09; p<0.0001). In KRAS wild types, carriers of BRAF and NRAS mutations had a significantly lower response rate than did BRAF and NRAS wild types, with a response rate of 8.3% (2/24) in carriers of BRAF mutations versus 38.0% in BRAF wild types (124/326; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.51; p=0.0012); and 7.7% (1/13) in carriers of NRAS mutations versus 38.1% in NRAS wild types (110/289; OR 0.14, 0.007-0.70; p=0.013). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with a response rate of 0.0% (0/9) versus 36.8% (121/329; OR 0.00, 0.00-0.89; p=0.029), a median PFS of 11.5 weeks versus 24 weeks (HR 2.52, 1.33-4.78; p=0.013), and a median overall survival of 34 weeks versus 51 weeks (3.29, 1.60-6.74; p=0.0057). Multivariate analysis and conditional inference trees confirmed that, if KRAS is not mutated, assessing BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations (in that order) gives additional information about outcome. Objective response rates in our series were 24.4% in the unselected population, 36.3% in the KRAS wild-type selected population, and 41.2% in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 wild-type population.   INTERPRETATION While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate. Objective response rates could be improved by additional genotyping of BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in a KRAS wild-type population.

Forty-two patients were included in analysis. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that plasma cortisol decreased significantly after 8 weeks of intervention without significant difference among the groups.

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the in vivo relationship between A\u03b2 accumulation and neuroinflammation in those specific brain regions in early AD.MethodsEleven nootropic drug-na\u00efve AD patients underwent a series of positron emission tomography (PET) measurements with [11C](R)PK11195, [11C]PIB and [18F]FDG and a battery of cognitive tests within the same day.

METHODS Seventeen patients with SLE who were enrolled in a clinical trial of belimumab, a BLyS-specific inhibitor, plus standard of care therapy were studied. Phenotypic analysis of lymphocytes was performed using flow cytometry. Circulating antibody-secreting cells were enumerated using enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Serum was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an antibody that recognizes products of the V(H)4-34 gene. Lymphocyte counts, Ig levels, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels were available as part of the clinical trial analyses.   RESULTS Samples were collected on days 0, 84, 168, 365, and 532 and after day 730. The total number of B cells started to decrease from baseline between days 84 and 168. This was due to a decrease in naive and transitional B cells. CD27+IgD+ memory B cells and plasmablasts decreased only after 532 days, whereas CD27+IgD- memory B cells were not affected, and there were no changes in T cells. Serum IgM levels began to decline between days 84 and 168, but there were no changes in serum levels of IgG, IgG anti-DNA antibodies, or V(H)4-34 antibodies during the study.

Primary-care providers lack efficient tools to identify children at high risk for exacerbations. We aimed to construct a clinical score to help providers to identify such children.   METHODS Our main outcome was severe asthma exacerbation, which was defined as any hospitalization, urgent visit, or systemic steroid course for asthma in the previous year, in children. A clinical score, consisting of a checklist questionnaire made up of 17 yes-no questions regarding asthma symptoms, use of medications and health-care services, and history, was built and validated in a cross-sectional study of Costa Rican children with asthma. It was then evaluated using data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), a longitudinal trial cohort of North American children.   RESULTS Compared with children at average risk for an exacerbation in the Costa Rican validation set, the odds of an exacerbation among children in the low-risk (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4) and high-risk (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.5-19.2) score categories were significantly reduced and increased, respectively.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of d-amphetamine delivery from LDX, and intact LDX with increasing doses of LDX administered in children with ADHD.   METHODS This single-dose, randomized, open-label, 3-period crossover study was conducted in children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD symptoms that adversely affected school performance and required a medication switch. Eligible patients had prior stimulant experience, with good tolerability. Patients were administered a single oral dose of LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg in a randomized sequence. Each study period was separated by a 6-day washout. The pharmacokinetic properties of d-amphetamine and intact LDX were calculated over 48 hours.

These findings suggest that the overall AUC for d-amphetamine was dose proportional. The intact LDX AUC was 10% to 20% higher in girls than in boys, and for d-amphetamine was <10% higher. The most commonly reported AEs, of 17 total cases, with 30-, 50-, and 70-mg LDX were anorexia (4 [22%], 7 [41%], and 8 [47%], respectively), elevated blood pressure (2 [11%], 1 [6%], and 3 [18%]), and abdominal pain (2 [11%], 2 [12%], and 2 [12%]).

In type 1 diabetes, clinical guidelines indicate that high-quality, child-centred information underpins achievement of optimal glycaemic control with the aim of minimising acute readmissions and reducing the risk of complications in later life. This paper describes the development of a range of child-centred diabetes information resources and outlines the study design and protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the information resources in routine practice. The aim of the diabetes information intervention is to improve children and young people's quality of life by increasing self-efficacy in managing their type 1 diabetes.Methods/DesignWe used published evidence, undertook qualitative research and consulted with children, young people and key stakeholders to design and produce a range of child-centred, age-appropriate children's diabetes diaries, carbohydrate recording sheets, and assembled child-centred, age-appropriate diabetes information packs containing published information in a folder that can be personalized by children and young people with pens and stickers. Resources have been designed for children/young people 6-10; 11-15; and 16-18 years.To evaluate the information resources, we designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and implementation in routine practice of individually tailored, age-appropriate diabetes diaries and information packs for children and young people age 6-18years, compared with currently available standard practice.Children and young people will be stratified by gender, length of time since diagnosis (< 2years and > 2years) and age (6-10; 11-15; and 16-18 years).

Methods and Results\u2014This study used data of a prospective per-patient randomized controlled trial. Automated external defibrillators used by first responders were randomized to either (1) perform postshock analysis and prompt rescuers to a pulse check (GL2000), or (2) resume CPR immediately after defibrillation (GL2005). Continuous recordings of ECG and impedance signals were collected from all patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to whom a randomized automated external defibrillator was applied. We included patients with VF as their initial rhythm in whom CPR onset could be determined from the ECG and impedance signals. Time intervals are presented as median (Q1-to-Q3). Of 361 patients, 136 met the inclusion criteria: 68 were randomly assigned to GL2000 and 68 to GL2005. Rescuers resumed CPR 30 (21-to-39) and 8 (7-to-9) seconds, respectively, after the first shock that successfully terminated VF (P<0.001); VF recurred after 40 (21-to-76) and 21 (10-to-80) seconds, respectively (P=0.001). The time interval between start of CPR and VF recurrence was 6 (0-to-67) and 8 (3-to-61) seconds, respectively (P=0.88). The hazard ratio for VF recurrence in the first 2 seconds of CPR was 15.5 (95% confidence interval, 5.63 to 57.7) compared with before CPR resumption. After more than 8 seconds of CPR, the hazard of VF recurrence was similar to before CPR resumption. Conclusions\u2014Early CPR resumption after defibrillation causes early VF recurrence.

The selective estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, exerts a part of its actions through the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) activation. We explored if polymorphisms of the ESR1 modify the effects of 6 months raloxifene treatment on endothelial function.   METHODS A total of 53 postmenopausal women, mean age 59.7+/-6.2, finished the prospective clinical trial. The PvuII, XbaI, and P325P polymorphisms of the ESR1 gene were analyzed. In all subjects endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were measured before and after 6 months of raloxifene treatment.   RESULTS There was no difference in FMD between the ESR1 genotypes, at baseline. After raloxifene treatment, the FMD was significantly greater in subjects with XX genotype of XbaI polymorphism compared to xx (p=0.03) and borderline greater when compared to Xx genotype (p=0.053). The FMD increased significantly with raloxifene treatment in women with Xx genotype of XbaI and Pp genotype of PvuII polymorphisms (p=0.027 and p=0.034, respectively). The P325P polymorphism did not influence the FMD after raloxifene. None of the ESR1 gene polymorphisms had any impact on the levels of CAM before or after the treatment. When analysing the whole group, a significant decrease in E-selectin (p<0.001) and a small increase in ICAM-1 levels (p=0.029) was observed with raloxifene treatment, but no influence on VCAM-1 levels or FMD overall was seen.

DESIGN A multicentre, randomised controlled trial with two arms.   SETTING The ECMO centre at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, and approved conventional treatment centres and referring hospitals throughout the UK.   PARTICIPANTS Patients aged 18-65 years with severe, but potentially reversible, respiratory failure, defined as a Murray lung injury score > or = 3.0, or uncompensated hypercapnoea with a pH < 7.20 despite optimal conventional treatment.   INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomised to conventional management (CM) or to consideration of ECMO.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was death or severe disability at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included a range of hospital indices: duration of ventilation, use of high frequency/oscillation/jet ventilation, use of nitric oxide, prone positioning, use of steroids, length of intensive care unit stay, and length of hospital stay - and (for ECMO patients only) mode (venovenous/veno-arterial), duration of ECMO, blood flow and sweep flow.   RESULTS A total of 180 patients (90 in each arm) were randomised from 68 centres. Three patients in the conventional arm did not give permission to be followed up. Of the 90 patients randomised to the ECMO arm, 68 received that treatment. ECMO was not given to three patients who died prior to transfer, two who died in transit, 16 who improved with conventional treatment given by the ECMO team and one who required amputation and could not therefore be heparinised. Ninety patients entered the CM (control) arm, three patients later withdrew and refused follow-up (meaning that they were alive), leaving 87 patients for whom primary outcome measures were available. CM consisted of any treatment deemed appropriate by the patient's intensivist with the exception of extracorporeal gas exchange. No CM patients received ECMO, although one received a form of experimental extracorporeal arteriovenous carbon dioxide removal support (a clear protocol violation). Fewer patients in the ECMO arm than in the CM arm had died or were severely disabled 6 months after randomisation, [33/90 (36.7%) versus 46/87 (52.9%) respectively]. This equated to one extra survivor for every six patients treated. Only one patient (in the CM arm) was known to be severely disabled at 6 months. Patients allocated to ECMO incurred average total costs of 73,979 pounds compared with 33,435 pounds for those undergoing CM (UK prices, 2005). A lifetime model predicted the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of ECMO to be 19,252 pounds (95% confidence interval 7622 pounds to 59,200 pounds) at a discount rate of 3.5%. Lifetime QALYs gained were 10.75 for the ECMO group compared with 7.31 for the conventional group. Costs to patients and their relatives, including out of pocket and time costs, were higher for patients allocated to ECMO.   CONCLUSIONS Compared with CM, transferring adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure to a single centre specialising in the treatment of severe respiratory failure for consideration of ECMO significantly increased survival without severe disability. Use of ECMO in this way is likely to be cost-effective when compared with other technologies currently competing for health resources.

In addition, we evaluated whether a loading dose of L-arginine triggers an acute migraine headache in migraineurs. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy subjects and 20 migraine patients participated in a 2-period, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each subject received a 30-min infusion, by peripheral vein, of 30\u2009g L-arginine hydrochloride or placebo (i.e. an equal volume of 0.9% saline solution). Meanwhile, biomarkers associated with the L-arginine\u2013NO pathway (i.e. exhaled NO/nasal NO), plasma citrulline and urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate and cGMP were assessed before and for 6\u2009h following the start of the infusion. Results: At baseline, exhaled NO and nasal NO were higher in migraineurs compared to healthy subjects (mean\u2009\u00b1\u200995% confidence interval): 15.9 (8.8, 23.0) parts per billion (ppb) versus 10.8 (7.0, 14.5) ppb for exhaled NO (P\u2009=\u20090.04) and 76.3 (61.2, 91.4) versus 61.6 (51.2, 72.0) ppb for nasal NO (P\u2009=\u20090.03), respectively. The AUC0\u20136 in ppb for exhaled NO and nasal NO following L-arginine or saline infusion did not differ between both groups. The increase in L-citrulline, following L-arginine infusion, was smaller in migraine patients (15 (13, 18) \u00b5mol/l) compared to healthy volunteers (19 (16, 23) \u00b5mol/l; P\u2009=\u20090.046). In healthy subjects, both nitrate and cGMP excretion were higher following L-arginine compared to placebo infusion: 132.63 (100.24, 165.02) versus 92.07 (66.33, 117.82) \u00b5mol/mmol creatinine for nitrate (P\u2009=\u20090.014) and 50.53 (42.19, 58.87) versus 39.64 (33.94, 45.34) nmol/mmol creatinine for cGMP (P\u2009=\u20090.0003), respectively.

This assumption has come under scrutiny as a number of recent studies have suggested that many symptoms of PTSD may not necessarily be the result of trauma and may merely represent general psychiatric symptoms that would have existed even in the absence of a trauma event but are subsequently misattributed to it. The current study tests this hypothesis.   METHOD A case-control twin study conducted between 1996-2001 examined psychopathologic symptoms in a national convenience sample of 104 identical twin pairs discordant for combat exposure in Vietnam, with (n = 50) or without (n = 54) combat-related PTSD (DSM-IV-diagnosed) in the exposed twin. Psychometric measures used were the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. If a psychopathologic feature represents a factor that would have existed even without traumatic exposure, then there is a high chance that it would also be found at elevated rates in the non-trauma-exposed, identical cotwins of trauma-exposed twins with PTSD. In contrast, if a psychopathologic feature is acquired as a result of an environmental factor unique to the exposed twin, eg, the traumatic event, their cotwins should not have an increased incidence of the feature.   RESULTS Combat veterans with PTSD demonstrated significantly higher scores (P < .0001) on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and other psychometric measures of psychopathology than their own combat-unexposed cotwins (and than combat veterans without PTSD and their cotwins).

We examined whether shaping improved outcomes in HTT smokers (never abstinent during a 10-visit baseline).   METHOD Smokers were stratified into HTT (n = 96) and easier-to-treat (ETT [abstinent at least once during baseline]; n = 50) and randomly assigned to either CM or CM with shaping (CMS). CM provided incentives for breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels <4 ppm (approximately 1 day of abstinence). CMS shaped abstinence by providing incentives for COs lower than the 7th lowest of the participant's last 9 samples or <4 ppm. Interventions lasted for 60 successive weekday visits.

To date, there has been no detailed in vivo human analysis of the histopathologic sequelae of acellular cadaveric dermis in implant-based breast reconstruction. Based on clinical observations, we hypothesize that acellular cadaveric dermis decreases the inflammatory response and foreign body reaction normally seen around breast implants. Methods: Twenty patients underwent tissue expander reconstruction using the \u201cdual-plane\u201d acellular cadaveric dermis technique (AlloDerm). During implant exchange, intraoperative biopsy specimens were obtained of (1) biointegrated acellular cadaveric dermis and (2) native subpectoral capsule (internal control). Histopathologic analysis was performed. Masked biopsy specimens were scored semiquantitatively by an experienced histopathologist to reflect observed granulation tissue formation, vessel proliferation, chronic inflammatory changes, capsule fibrosis, fibroblast cellularity, and foreign body giant cell inflammatory reaction. Scores were analyzed statistically using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Acellular cadaveric dermis (AlloDerm) had statistically diminished levels for all parameters compared with corresponding native breast capsules (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This represents the first detailed histopathologic comparative analysis between biointegrated acellular cadaveric dermis and native capsules in implant-based breast reconstruction. These histopathologic findings suggest that certain properties intrinsic to acellular cadaveric dermis may limit capsule formation by diminishing inflammatory changes that initiate capsule formation.

We hypothesized that vessel- and lesion-specific CAC scores are more accurate.   OBJECTIVES To evaluate the usefulness of vessel- and lesion-specific CAC in predicting obstructive CAD and to assess the incremental value added by the vessel- and lesion-specific CAC to the conventional whole-heart CAC approach.   METHODS Ninety-one patients with CAC scores and invasive angiography (XRA) data were enrolled. Besides whole-heart CAC, Agatston score (AgSc) and volume score (VolSc) were measured individually for each lesion in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries. Maximum and average lesion-specific scores in each vessel were also determined. For the primary analysis, obstructive CAD was defined as 50% diameter stenosis by XRA.   RESULTS Whole-heart AgSc and VolSc were not different between patients with and without obstructive CAD (P = .23 and P = .18), whereas vessel- and lesion-specific scores were (maximum lesion specific AgSc, P < .0001). Maximum lesion-specific AgSc had superior diagnostic performance compared with whole-heart AgSc (area under receiver operating characteristics, 0.71 vs 0.58). Overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were improved. When specificity was fixed at 80%, sensitivity of maximum lesion-specific AgSc was superior to whole-heart AgSc (56.6% vs 35.1%). Most importantly, with lesion-specific AgSc, fewer patients were classified as \"indeterminate\" compared with whole-heart AgSc (17.9% vs 50%).

BACKGROUND At the time of MPI, hybrid systems obtain a low-dose, non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated CT scan that is used to perform attenuation correction. Utility of this CTAC scan in estimating actual CAC as measured by Agatston score (AS) on standard ECG-gated scans has not been previously studied.   METHODS A total of 492 patients, from 3 centers, receiving both MPI with CTAC and a standard CAC scan were studied. At each site, experienced readers blinded to AS reviewed CTAC images, visually estimating CAC on a 6-level scale: classifying patients as estimated AS of 0, 1 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 300, 400 to 999, or \u22651,000. Agreement between visually estimated coronary artery calcium (VECAC) on CTAC and AS, measured standardly and converted to the same scale, was evaluated, as was inter-reader agreement.   RESULTS Although CTAC images are low dose and nongated, a high degree of association was observed between VECAC and AS, with 63% of VECACs in the same category as the AS category and 93% within 1 category. Weighted kappa was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.88 to 0.91, p < 0.0001). High weighted kappa statistics were observed for each site, scanner type, and sex.

To explore the ideas of patients and providers for potentially feasible, individualized, cost-effective ways to reduce obstacles to care by providing social support using a patient advocate or navigator. Methods. The authors conducted four focus groups of adults with moderate or severe asthma. Participants were recruited from clinics serving low-income and minority urban neighborhoods.

Results. Patients and providers agreed that a patient navigator could help patients manage asthma by giving social support. Both groups found instrumental and informational support most important. However, patients desired more instrumental help whereas providers focused on informational support.

In the multivariate analysis, predictors of joint replacement were as follows: Kellgren and Lawrence radiographic grade (grade \u2265III vs <III, hazards ratio (HR) = 4.08 (95% CI 2.34 to 7.12), p<0.0001); ultrasonographic knee effusion (\u22654 mm vs <4 mm) (HR = 2.63 (95% CI 1.70 to 4.06), p<0.0001); knee pain intensity on a 0\u2013100 mm visual analogue scale (\u226560 vs <60) (HR = 1.81 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.83), p=0.01) and disease duration (\u22655 years vs <5 years) (HR=1.63 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.47), p=0.02).

Objectives:Demonstrate functions of a distributed research network that supports research needs and also address data holders concerns about participation. Key design functions included strong local control of data uses and a centralized web-based querying interface. Research Design:We implemented a pilot distributed research network and evaluated the design considerations, utility for research, and the acceptability to data holders of methods for menu-driven querying. We developed and tested a central, web-based interface with supporting network software. Specific functions assessed include query formation and distribution, query execution and review, and aggregation of results. Results:This pilot successfully evaluated temporal trends in medication use and diagnoses at 5 separate sites, demonstrating some of the possibilities of using a distributed research network. The pilot demonstrated the potential utility of the design, which addressed the major concerns of both users and data holders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients age 16 to 75 years with newly diagnosed early unfavorable HL were randomly assigned in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design to one of the following treatment arms: four cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) + 30 Gy of IFRT; four cycles of ABVD + 20 Gy of IFRT; four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP(baseline)) + 30 Gy of IFRT; or four cycles of BEACOPP(baseline) + 20 Gy of IFRT.   RESULTS With a total of 1,395 patients included, the freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) at 5 years was 85.0%, overall survival was 94.5%, and progression-free survival was 86.0%. BEACOPP(baseline) was more effective than ABVD when followed by 20 Gy of IFRT (5-year FFTF difference, 5.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 11.3%).

Methods: Thirty patients with MTLE were prospectively randomized to receive 20 or 24 Gy 50% isodose RS centered at the amygdala, 2 cm of the anterior hippocampus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. Posttreatment MRI was evaluated quantitatively for abnormal T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement, mass effect, and qualitatively for spectroscopic and diffusion changes.

Results: Despite highly standardized dose targeting, RS produced variable MRI alterations. In patients with multiple serial imaging, the appearance of vasogenic edema occurred approximately 9\u201312 months after RS and correlated with onset of seizure remission. Diffusion and spectroscopy-detected alterations were consistent with a mechanism of temporal lobe radiation injury mediated by local vascular insult and neuronal loss.

OBJECTIVE We report our results on a prospective randomized trial of open versus robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy with regard to perioperative outcomes, complications, and short-term narcotic usage.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective randomized single-center noninferiority study comparing open versus robotic approaches to cystectomy in patients who are candidates for radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Of the 41 patients who underwent surgery, 21 were randomized to the robotic approach and 20 to the open technique.   INTERVENTION Radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and urinary diversion by either an open approach or by a robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique.   MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was lymph node (LN) yield with a noninferiority margin of four LNs. Secondary end points included demographic characteristics, perioperative outcomes, pathologic results, and short-term narcotic use.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS On univariate analysis, no significant differences were found between the two groups with regard to age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, anticoagulation regimen of aspirin, clinical stage, or diversion type. Significant differences were noted in operating room time, estimated blood loss, time to flatus, time to bowel movement, and use of inpatient morphine sulfate equivalents. There was no significant difference in regard to overall complication rate or hospital stay. On surgical pathology, in the robotic group 14 patients had pT2 disease or higher; 3 patients had pT3/T4 disease; and 4 patients had node-positive disease. In the open group, eight patients had pT2 disease or higher; five patients had pT3/T4 disease; and seven patients had node-positive disease.

A reliable and valid adherence measurement based on the patient's self-report may be helpful in daily practice.   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING In a primary care sample with 353 hypertensive patients, we applied two self-rating instruments to assess medication adherence (the \"Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale\" and Morisky's \"Self-Reported Measure of Medication Adherence\") and compared their psychometric properties.   RESULTS Both scales showed low acceptability and insufficiency to moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.25 and 0.73, respectively).

The focus was a supine bilateral leg-loading task that incorporated a slide (level 4) or no slide (level 5). Thirty-three healthy subjects (mean age 24 years) completed the task while surface electromyograms (EMG) from 5 abdominal muscle sites were recorded. Subjects were assigned to stable or unstable groups based on their ability to minimize lumbar-pelvic motion. After time and amplitude normalization, electromyography waveforms were entered into a pattern recognition procedure and scores for each principal pattern were calculated. Four principal patterns explained 90% of variance in the waveform data, with these principal patterns capturing the mean pattern, the relative amplitude change during the leg-extension phase, and subtle changes in shape throughout the exercise. Significant interactions (p < 0.05) were found for principal patterns; 1, 2, and 4 scores; and significant main (p < 0.05) effects for principal pattern 3 scores. These results illustrate temporal synchrony among the abdominal wall muscle activation during the bilateral leg-loading tasks; however, there was less variability in the activation patterns during the leg-lift and leg extension-phases for those who were able to minimize lumbar-pelvic motion compared to those who were unable to perform the task correctly.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation absorbed dose of [11C]docetaxel in humans.MethodsBiodistribution of [11C]docetaxel was measured in seven patients (five men and two women) with solid tumours using PET/CT. Venous blood samples were collected to measure activity in blood and plasma. Regions of interest (ROI) for various source organs were defined on PET (high [11C]docetaxel uptake) or CT (low [11C]docetaxel uptake). ROI data were used to generate time-activity curves and to calculate percentage injected dose and residence times. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated according to the MIRD method using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software.ResultsGall bladder and liver demonstrated high [11C]docetaxel uptake, whilst uptake in brain and normal lung was low.

The intervention consisted of high-intensity, body-weight\u2013supported treadmill training; progressive resistance strength training; and aerobic exercise. The main outcome measures were gait performance (Six-Minute Walk Test, 10-Meter Walk Test, and aerobic capacity) and parameters of cardiovascular health (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, and resting heart rate). Results Significant improvements in all main outcome parameters were observed in response to the intervention. Gait speed during the Six-Minute Walk Test increased 62%, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased 10% and 11%, respectively. Weekly testing of walking speed showed that most of the increase in the walking speed occurred in the first 8 weeks of training. Correlation analyses showed that improvements were unrelated to age, chronicity, or level of functioning. Conclusions High-intensity physical training for people with stroke in the chronic stage increased walking speed regardless of chronicity, age, or level of functioning. Further studies should investigate the intervention duration needed to reach the full potential of gait recovery.", "1_year_count": 8, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "bb57a78ce89f1b5fa90f67613b15658ac96b4896", "text": "AIMS To examine the extent of delay from initial hospital presentation to fibrinolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), characteristics associated with prolonged delay, and changes in delay patterns over time in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).   METHODS AND RESULTS We analysed data from 5170 patients with STEMI enrolled in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events from 2003 to 2007. The median elapsed time from first hospital presentation to initiation of fibrinolysis was 30 min (interquartile range 18-60) and to primary PCI was 86 min (interquartile range 53-135). Over the years under study, there were no significant changes in delay times to treatment with either strategy. Geographic region was the strongest predictor of delay to initiation of fibrinolysis >30 min. Patient's transfer status and geographic location were strongly associated with delay to primary PCI. Patients treated in Europe were least likely to experience delay to fibrinolysis or primary PCI.

Clinical data were obtained form 2 trials of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. The four event probabilities: remission rates, rates of non-remission, discontinuation rates due to intolerance, and incidence of serious adverse events were estimated. Direct costs included drug cost, hospitalizations, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The primary outcome considered in the model was a remission of symptoms. Outputs were measured in terms of costs per remission and costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).   RESULTS In the base-case analysis, the total direct costs with a bupropion switch were 22,937 THB per remission and 29,346 THB per remission with a bupropion combination. Compared with combination option, switching to bupropion also had lower total cost per QALY (28,672 THB vs. 36,682 THB) and had cost saving of 21.8%. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the combination regimen compared with the switching regimen was 6,409 THB per remission gained and 8,011 THB per QALY gained.

Using large-scale simulations we demonstrate the benefits and network-level impact of running multiple routing protocols. We demonstrate that applications are more efficient and do not generate additional control traffic overhead.

The optimal treatment after thrombolysis is still unclear.   METHODS A total of 266 patients with acute STEMI living in rural areas with more than 90-min transfer delays to PCI were treated with tenecteplase, aspirin, enoxaparin, and clopidogrel and randomized to immediate transfer for PCI or to standard management in the local hospitals with early transfer, only if indicated for rescue or clinical deterioration. The primary outcome was a composite of death, reinfarction, stroke, or new ischemia at 12 months, and analysis was by intention to treat.   RESULTS The primary end point was reached in 28 patients (21%) in the early invasive group compared with 36 (27%) in the conservative group (hazard ratio: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 1.18, p = 0.19).

Construct validity of the resulting HRQOLISP-40 was assessed by comparison with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Stroke Levity Scale (SLS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey.   RESULTS In multicultural settings, the HRQOLISP-40 showed good internal consistency (\u03b1 = .76, .86) and test-retest reliability. It retained its discriminant validity between stroke and healthy participants and demonstrated good \"known-groups\" validity in its relationship to the SLS, NIHSS, and mRS in the physical sphere. The physical sphere showed good convergent validity with corresponding facets of the SF-36.   CONCLUSIONS Despite item reduction, the HRQOLISP-40 demonstrated excellent psychometric properties and is valid for routine use and clinical trials in stroke. The relative preservation of the spiritual sphere demonstrated the concept of disability disparity. Its ability to simultaneously assess the physical and spiritual spheres may be beneficial in studies aimed at potentiating internal adaptation in stroke patients.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "65a6b420b82c07df4890293724cb6134ee5c97a1", "text": "PurposeDynamic PET studies with 18F-FDG were performed in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas who received conventional chemotherapy with doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) and ifosfamide (AI-G). The goal of the study was to evaluate the impact of full kinetic analysis and assess its value with regard to the therapy outcome based on survival data.MethodsThe evaluation included 17 patients with 29 metastatic lesions of soft tissue sarcomas, who were treated with chemotherapy consisting of an AI-G regimen prior to high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation where applicable. Patients were examined prior to onset of therapy and after completion of the first cycle of AI-G. Restaging data (n\u2009=\u200917) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were available. Survival data (n\u2009=\u200914) served for reference. The following parameters were retrieved from the dynamic PET studies: standardized uptake value (SUV), fractal dimension, two-compartment model with computation of k1, k2, k3, k4 (unit: 1/min), the fractional blood volume and the FDG influx calculated according to Patlak.ResultsThe mean SUV was 6.9 prior to therapy and 4.7 after one cycle. The mean influx was 0.066 prior to therapy in comparison to 0.058 after one cycle. We dichotomized the patients according to the median survival time of 320\u00a0days into response (n\u2009=\u20096) and non-response (n\u2009=\u20098). The mean SUV was 7.6 in the group of responders and 5.4 in the group of non-responders prior to therapy. Responders revealed a mean SUV of 3.8 after therapy as compared to 5.0 SUV for non-responders. We used discriminant analysis to classify the patients into the two response groups. The classification of the non-responders was generally higher (negative predictive value\u2009>\u200961%) than for the responders. Finally, the combined use of the four predictor variables, namely mean SUV and k1 of both studies led to the highest accuracy of 90% for both groups.ConclusionThe data demonstrate that only a multiparameter analysis based on a combination of the absolute values of mean SUV and k1 of a baseline study and a follow-up study after completion of one cycle was the best combination for a group-based analysis, into response or non-response. The quantitative assessment of the FDG kinetics in tumours should be used to quantify the \u201cinhibitory effect\u201d of chemotherapy and to individualize treatment.

The prevalence rate varies from 4% to 16.7% among different clinical psychiatric populations.1,2 The exact etiology of SRED is unclear, but it is postulated that SRED might share features of both sleepwalking and eating disorders.3 In addition, there have been accumulating reports of SRED related to the use of various psychotropic medications including triazolam, zolpidem, olanzapine, risperidone, and combinations of psychotropics.4\u20138 Among these drugs, recent attention has focused on zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Our clinical epidemiologic study in psychiatric outpatients2 showed that 1 out of 7 subjects regularly taking zolpidem could develop SRED in their lifetime. In addition, among a psychiatric population, most of the adult-onset sleepwalking cases were highly comorbid with SRED features.9 Thus, there seems to be a robust association of zolpidem and SRED on the basis of both cross-sectional clinical series and epidemiologic evidence. Warnings were issued in 2007 by both the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia10 and US Food and Drug Administration11 with regard to SRED as a potential side effect of zolpidem. Nonetheless, in order to confirm a definite association of zolpidem and SRED, resolution or reduction of SRED symptoms upon cessation of zolpidem treatment should be demonstrated. In particular, the episodic nature of the SRED attacks would argue the need for a longer-term follow-up period to document a clear resolution of the symptoms.", "1_year_count": 3, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "efaa1473368c79ada2c7368c401a193de624f188", "text": "Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have a significantly lower peak aerobic capacity compared to healthy subjects, and, may therefore experience more inconvenience during the performance of domestic activities of daily life (ADLs).

General demographics, pulmonary function, body composition and peak aerobic capacity were assessed in 23 CHF outpatients and 20 healthy peers. In addition, the metabolic requirement of five simple self-paced domestic ADLs was assessed using a mobile oxycon.

Methods and Findings Single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of high-dose folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12 in 271 individuals (of 646 screened) over 70 y old with mild cognitive impairment. A subset (187) volunteered to have cranial MRI scans at the start and finish of the study. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups of equal size, one treated with folic acid (0.8 mg/d), vitamin B12 (0.5 mg/d) and vitamin B6 (20 mg/d), the other with placebo; treatment was for 24 months. The main outcome measure was the change in the rate of atrophy of the whole brain assessed by serial volumetric MRI scans. Results A total of 168 participants (85 in active treatment group; 83 receiving placebo) completed the MRI section of the trial. The mean rate of brain atrophy per year was 0.76% [95% CI, 0.63\u20130.90] in the active treatment group and 1.08% [0.94\u20131.22] in the placebo group (P\u200a=\u200a0.001).

A greater rate of atrophy was associated with a lower final cognitive test scores. There was no difference in serious adverse events according to treatment category. Conclusions and Significance The accelerated rate of brain atrophy in elderly with mild cognitive impairment can be slowed by treatment with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins. Sixteen percent of those over 70 y old have mild cognitive impairment and half of these develop Alzheimer's disease. Since accelerated brain atrophy is a characteristic of subjects with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease, trials are needed to see if the same treatment will delay the development of Alzheimer's disease.

SNPs in the ADH gene cluster located on chromosome 4q (n = 491) were subdivided in seven gene sets: ADH5, ADH4, ADH6, ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH7. Within these sets associations of SNPs with alcohol consumption measures, age at onset variables, reactions to alcohol and problem drinking liability were examined. Of the original 38 SNPs studied by Macgregor et al. (2009), six SNPs were not available in our dataset, because one of them had a minor allele frequency < .01 (rs1229984) and five could not be imputed. The remaining SNP associations with alcohol phenotypes as identified by Macgregor et al. (2009) were not replicated in the Dutch sample, after correcting for multiple genotype and phenotype testing. Significant associations were found however, for reactions to alcohol with a SNP in ADH5 (rs6827292, p = .001) and a SNP just upstream of ADH5 (rs6819724, p = .0007) that is in strong LD with rs6827292. Furthermore, an association between age at onset of regular alcohol use and a SNP just upstream of ADH7 (rs2654849, p = .003) was observed. No significant associations were found for alcohol consumption and problem drinking liability.

Objectives: The current study assessed the relationship between PTA duration and probability thresholds for Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) levels. Methods: Data were prospectively collected in this multicentre observational study. The cohort was a consecutive sample of rehabilitation patients enrolled in the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research funded TBI Model Systems (n\u200a=\u200a1332) that had documented finite PTA duration greater than 24 h, and 1-year and 2-year GOS. Results: The cohort had proportionally more Good Recovery (44% vs 39%) and less Severe Disability (19% vs 23%) at year 2 than at year 1. Longer PTA resulted in an incremental decline in probability of Good Recovery and a corresponding increase in probability of Severe Disability. When PTA ended within 4 weeks, Severe Disability was unlikely (<15% chance) at year 1, and Good Recovery was the most likely GOS at year 2. When PTA lasted beyond 8 weeks, Good Recovery was highly unlikely (<10% chance) at year 1, and Severe Disability was equal to or more likely than Moderate Disability at year 2. Conclusions: Two PTA durations, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, emerged as particularly salient GOS probability thresholds that may aid prognostication after TBI.", "1_year_count": 7, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "bda9e2909d1d9099e33b94f5eb2e901e29eae019", "text": "AIMS This randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of Technosphere insulin (MannKind Corp., Valencia, CA) delivered via the MedTone inhaler (MannKind Corp.) on quality of life and treatment satisfaction in adults with type 2 diabetes.   METHODS Subjects were 119 insulin-naive subjects with starting hemoglobin A1c >6.5%: 58 in the active inhaled insulin arm and 61 in the inhaled placebo arm (67% male; mean age 55 years; mean duration of diagnosed diabetes 7 years). Subjects completed a measure of health-related quality of life (the SF-36) and a measure of treatment satisfaction (the Insulin Treatment Questionnaire [ITQ]) before starting insulin treatment and approximately 12 weeks later. The ITQ assesses Diabetes Worries, Perceptions of Insulin Therapy, and Inhaler Performance.   RESULTS There was no significant change in any SF-36 factor or Diabetes Worries during the trial in either arm, and there were no significant between-arm differences in change on any of these measures. Perceptions of Insulin Therapy improved significantly during the trial in the active medication arm (effect size for composite measure = 0.56, P = 0.002) but not in the placebo arm; there were no significant between-arm differences in change. The majority of subjects gave positive ratings of Inhaler Performance on all items (median = 93% positive ratings).

METHODS Patients with persistent macular edema (> or = 90 days' duration) were randomized to treatment with 700 microg or 350 microg of dexamethasone DDS or observation. One eye from each patient was designated as the study eye. The analysis is of the eyes in this study with DME (n = 171).   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the proportion of eyes that achieved an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 10 letters or more from baseline at day 90. Other outcome measures included fluorescein leakage, central retinal thickness, and safety parameters.   RESULTS At day 90, a BCVA improvement of 10 letters or more was seen in more eyes in the 700-microg group (33.3%) and 350-microg group (21.1%) than the observation group (12.3%; P = .007 vs 700-microg group). At day 180, a BCVA improvement of 10 letters or more was seen in 30% of eyes in the 700-microg group, 19% in the 350-microg group, and 23% in the observation group (P > or = .4 for treated vs observed eyes). There were also significantly greater improvements in central retinal thickness and fluorescein leakage in treated eyes than observed eyes (P = .03; day 90). Dexamethasone DDS was well tolerated.   CONCLUSIONS In eyes with persistent DME, treatment with 700 microg of intravitreal dexamethasone DDS is well tolerated and produces significant improvements in BCVA, central retinal thickness, and fluorescein leakage compared with observation (statistically significant at day 90).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and results of giving imatinib concurrently with intensive chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and post-transplant imatinib maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Design and Methods This was a phase II study of patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL given standard chemotherapy, together with imatinib (400 mg/day) until stem cell transplantation, followed by imatinib maintenance therapy for all patients regardless of the molecular status of the disease. Results Of the 30 patients included, 27 (90%) achieved complete remission, one was resistant to treatment and two died during induction therapy. The percentages of major and complete molecular responses were 86% and 21% after induction, and 81% and 65% after consolidation, respectively. Similar results were observed assessing minimal residual disease by flow cytometry. Of the 27 patients who achieved complete remission, 21 underwent stem cell transplantation (16 allogeneic, 5 autologous). Imatinib (400 mg/day) could be administered after transplantation for a median of 3.9 months in 12 patients, although it was interrupted in 10 patients (in 2 cases because of side effects of the drug).

There is little empirical research into this topic.MethodsThe subjects (n = 597) are a subgroup of a random population sample of 1410 men and women aged 57-78 years who are participating in a 4-year randomized controlled intervention trial on the effects of physical exercise and diet on atherosclerosis, endothelial function and cognition. Data were collected in two steps: A questionnaire about informed consent was given to all willing participants (n = 1324) three months after the randomization. Data on implementation and success in the exercise and diet interventions were evaluated at 12 months by intervention-group personnel. The main purpose of the analysis procedure performed in this study was to identify and examine potential correlates for the chosen dependent variables and to generate future hypotheses for testing and confirming the independent determinants for implementation and success. The nature of the analysis protocol is exploratory at this stage.ResultsAbout half of the participants (54%) had achieved good results in the intervention. Nearly half of the participants (47%) had added to or improved their own activity in some sector of exercise or diet. Significant associations were found between performance in the interventions and participants' knowledge of the purpose of the study (p < 0.001), and between success in interventions and working status (p = 0.02), and the participants' knowledge of the purpose of the study (p = 0.04).ConclusionThe main finding of this study was that those participants who were most aware or had understood the purpose of the study at an early stage had also attained better results at their 12-month intervention evaluation.

Although most patients are initially responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, almost all develop recurrent chemoresistant tumors and succumb to their diseases. Elucidating the pathogenesis underlying drug resistance is fundamental to the development of new therapeutics, leading to improved clinical outcomes in these patients. Methods and Findings We compared the proteomes of paired primary and recurrent post-chemotherapy ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas from nine ovarian cancer patients using CIEF/Nano-RPLC coupled with ESI-Tandem MS. As compared to their primary tumors, more than half of the recurrent tumors expressed higher levels of several proteins including CP, FN1, SYK, CD97, AIF1, WNK1, SERPINA3, APOD, URP2, STAT5B and RELA (NF-\u03baB p65), which were also validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Based on shRNA screening for the upregulated genes in in vitro carboplatin-resistant cells, we found that simultaneous knockdown of RELA and STAT5B was most effective in sensitizing tumor cells for carboplatin treatment. Similarly, the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BMS-345541, and the STAT5 inhibitor, Dasatinib, significantly enhanced cell sensitivity to carboplatin. Moreover, both RELA and STAT5 are known to bind to the promoter region of Bcl-X, regulating its promoter activity. In this regard, augmented Bcl-xL expression was detected in carboplatin-resistant cells. Combined ectopic expression of RELA and STAT5B enhanced Bcl-xL promoter activity while treatment with BMS-345541 and Dasatinib decreased it. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the Bcl-X promoter region using a STAT5 antibody showed induction of RELA and STAT5 DNA-binding segments both in na\u00efve cells treated with a high concentration of carboplatin as well as in carboplatin-resistant cells. Conclusions Proteomic analysis identified RELA and STAT5 as two major proteins associated with carboplatin resistance in ovarian tumors.

Considering the different affinities of D2 dopamine receptors for typical and atypical NLPs, these drugs may differentially affect the functions of the striatum, a determinant brain structure involved in procedural learning. The influence of risperidone (2-6 mg) and haloperidol (2-40 mg) on a nonmotor procedural task involving semantically related pairs of words with inverted letters was investigated in this double-blind study. The performance of 26 patients with SZ, randomly assigned to risperidone or haloperidol, was compared to that of 18 healthy controls at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results revealed that all patients with SZ exhibited slower reading speed of the word pairs than healthy controls at all assessment periods. In addition, procedural learning - characterized as a significant decrease in the time taken to read aloud the target word pairs - was more impaired in the haloperidol- than in the risperidone-treated group at all assessment periods. Healthy controls showed steady improvement in reading speed over the 12 months of the study, in contrast to SZ patients, who reached a plateau in their capacity to improve mirror-reading skill over time. However, all SZ participants in the study showed near normal learning profiles from exposure to semantic associations embedded in the procedural memory task, providing evidence for the preservation of associative connections in the semantic network of these patients.

Metinel nodes (MNs) drain secondarily from metastatic tumors and also possess tumor-reactive lymphocytes, which might be a source for adoptive T-cell immunotherapy.   OBJECTIVES To determine if MN detection and subsequent expansion of autologous T-helper cells with subsequent reinfusion was feasible and safe to perform in patients with metastatic UBC.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In an open trial, the first 12 included patients are described. Patients were prospectively selected from a single tertiary academic center and had metastatic UBC. All 12 patients were preoperatively staged as T2-T4b N1-2 and/or M0-M1 or MX.   INTERVENTIONS MNs were excised in conjunction with intended cystectomy. T lymphocytes were extracted with enhancement and expansion of tumor specific T-helper cells, followed by reinfusion of expanded T cells.   MEASUREMENTS All patients were preoperatively staged with transurethral resection of the bladder and routine computed tomography scan. Intended detection of MNs was performed intraoperatively with intended cystectomy. Harvested T cells were evaluated and cell cultures were established. Assessment of reinfusion of expanded, autologous, tumor-specific T-helper cells to six of the patients was performed, focusing on adverse effects.

We sought to determine if new ultrastructural hippocampal details seen on 3T MR imaging had histopathologic correlates and whether these could serve as a useful tool in MTS identification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing selective anterior temporal lobectomy (n = 5) were scanned using 3T MR imaging preoperatively. En bloc resections were rescanned and subsequently prepared for histopathologic analysis of all hippocampal layers in the CA1\u20133 regions. Using a newly identified landmark from 3T FSTIR coronal images in 20 patients with histologically confirmed MTS, blinded studies compared ipsilateral and contralateral sides to generate threshold measurements for application in a fast quantitative analysis tool. RESULTS: Histopathologic analysis and correlation with 3T imaging of en bloc resections identified the low-intensity signal as the stratum lacunosum.

Post-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-choline examinations were performed in all patients between 8 and 12\u00a0weeks after combined intra-arterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The PET/CT images were evaluated using a patient-based analysis and a lesion-based analysis. All of the patients were prospectively followed for at least 9\u00a0months after the post-treatment PET/CT examination, with surveillance using conventional images (including CT and/or MRI) and a physical examination performed every 3\u00a0months.ResultsRecurrences, as determined using the patient-based analysis, were eventually confirmed in 18, 6 and 5 patients at 3, 4\u20136 and 7\u20139\u00a0months after the post-treatment PET/CT examination, respectively.

The purpose of the present study was to expand on these results by examining whether the addition of a work-transition component would further strengthen the effectiveness of this early intervention treatment. Methods Using an existing algorithm, participants were identified as being high-risk (HR) or low-risk (LR) for developing CLBPD. HR participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: early intervention (EI); early intervention with work transition (EI/WT); or standard care (SC). Participants provided information regarding pain, disability, work status, and psychosocial functioning at baseline, periodically during treatment, and again 1\u00a0year following completion of treatment. Results At 1-year follow-up, no significant differences were found between the EI and EI/WT groups in terms of occupational status, self-reports of pain and disability, coping ability or psychosocial functioning. However, significant differences in all these outcomes were found comparing these groups to standard care.

Methods: The medical charts of 578 children with vertebral trauma at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and the Hospital for Sick Children were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Forty-five patients were identified as having traumatic myelopathy. Three of these patients had SCIWORA. Two sustained thoracic spinal cord injuries as a result of motor vehicle accidents and permanent neurological deficits. The third was involved in a sports-related injury and sustained a cervical spine injury that improved in 48 h. Conclusions: SCIWORA is uncommon. The serious neurological sequelae that can result from a missed diagnosis merit more attention in identifying a spinal lesion in children with traumatic myelopathy. MRI has played a valuable role in this respect and may be even more predictive of outcome than the presenting neurological findings.

The early phase of motor sequence learning relies on the ventral and anterior striatal circuitry, whereas the late phase relies on the dorsal and posterior striatal circuitry. Early Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly characterized by dopaminergic denervation of the dorsal and posterior striatum while sparing anterior and ventral regions. Dopaminergic medication improves dorsal and posterior striatum function by compensating for the loss of dopamine. However, previous work has shown that dopaminergic medication interferes with the ventral and anterior striatum function by overdosing this relatively intact structure in early-state PD. Here we test whether these effects are also observed over the time course of motor sequence learning. Fourteen PD patients ON and OFF dopaminergic medications and 11 healthy age-matched control participants performed an explicit motor sequence learning task. When sequence learning was compared across different learning phases in patients ON and OFF medication, a significant impairment associated with medication was observed in the early relative to later phases of learning. The rate of learning in the early phase measured trial by trial in patients ON medication was significantly slower than that in controls and when patients were OFF medication. No significant impairment was found in the later learning phases. These results demonstrate that dopaminergic medications may selectively impair early-phase motor sequence learning.

Physiotherapy, the mainstay of treatment, lacks a robust evidence base. This study is aimed at determining the best physiotherapy intervention in managing childhood hypermobility.   METHODS A prospective randomized comparative trial (RCT) compared a 6-week generalized programme, improving muscular strength and fitness, with a targeted programme aimed at correcting motion control of symptomatic joints. Patients were assessed on symptom scores (pain/global-impact), function, muscle strength and fitness.   RESULTS Fifty-seven children, aged 7-16 years with symptomatic hypermobility, were randomly assign to receive a targeted (T; n = 30) or generalized (G; n = 27) programme. Statistically significant improvements were demonstrated in both the children's and parental pain scores across both the randomized groups between baseline and follow-up assessments (P < 0.05). However, the difference in improvement between the groups was not statistically significant. Child's assessment of change in pain score: mean difference (95% CI) T - G, 3.97 (-15.59, 20.85) at the end of treatment and 9.41 at 3-month follow-up (-17.42, 36.24). At the end of treatment, parental assessment of change in pain score, T - G was: -0.27 (-15.05, 14.50) and at 3-month follow-up it was: -9.48 (-26.40, 7.43).

DESIGN A prospective randomized trial.   PATIENTS Thirty-two moderate to severe, clinically stable malnourished COPD patients.   METHODS Patients were randomly divided into a nutritional supplementation with low-intensity exercise group and a control group. Lung function, maximum inspiratory and expiratory muscle force, the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ), the 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and the Borg scale were measured at baseline and were re-assessed at 3 months after intervention. The degree of systemic inflammation and the changes in levels of systemic CRP, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 were assessed before and after a combination nutritional supplementation with low-intensity exercise.   RESULTS Body weight and FFM increased significantly after 12 weeks of nutritional supplementation therapy in patients with COPD. The dietary intake energy increased and the REE:REEpred ratio decreased significantly in the nutrition with low-intensity exercise group. PI(max), Quadriceps muscle force and the 6-min walking distance (6MWD) increased significantly from baseline through week 12.

To determine the cost-effectiveness of wearing a lumbar support for home care workers with recurrent low back pain (LBP) (secondary prevention). Summary of Background Data. LBP is a large medical and economical burden. Evidence on the secondary preventive use of lumbar supports is sparse. Methods. A total of 360 home care workers with a self-reported history of LBP were randomly assigned to usual care or usual care plus wearing a lumbar support on working days with LBP, during a 1-year period. Primary clinical outcome measures were the average number of self-reported days with LBP, number of calendar days sick leave in general, and quality of life. Direct and indirect costs were measured by means of cost diaries. Differences in mean costs between groups, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility ratios were evaluated, and cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves presented by applying nonparametric bootstrapping techniques. Results. During the intervention period, the home care workers using a lumbar support in addition to usual care reported on average 54 fewer days with LBP (95% confidence interval [CI], \u221285 to \u221229). The estimated mean difference in sick leave was not statistically significant (\u22125.0 days per year in favor of the lumbar support group; 95% CI, \u221221.1 to 6.8).

We postulated that heart rate is also a risk factor for cardiovascular events in heart failure. In the SHIFT trial, patients with chronic heart failure were treated with the selective heart-rate-lowering agent ivabradine. We aimed to test our hypothesis by investigating the association between heart rate and events in this patient population.   METHODS We analysed cardiovascular outcomes in the placebo (n=3264) and ivabradine groups (n=3241) of this randomised trial, divided by quintiles of baseline heart rate in the placebo group. The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure. In the ivabradine group, heart rate achieved at 28 days was also analysed in relation to subsequent outcomes. Analysis adjusted to change in heart rate was used to study heart-rate reduction as mechanism for risk reduction by ivabradine directly.   FINDINGS In the placebo group, patients with the highest heart rates (>or=87 beats per min [bpm], n=682, 286 events) were at more than two-fold higher risk for the primary composite endpoint than were patients with the lowest heart rates (70 to <72 bpm, n=461, 92 events; hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, 95% CI 1.84-2.98, p<0.0001). Risk of primary composite endpoint events increased by 3% with every beat increase from baseline heart rate and 16% for every 5-bpm increase. In the ivabradine group, there was a direct association between heart rate achieved at 28 days and subsequent cardiac outcomes. Patients with heart rates lower than 60 bpm at 28 days on treatment had fewer primary composite endpoint events during the study (n=1192; event rate 17.4%, 95% CI 15.3-19.6) than did patients with higher heart rates. The effect of ivabradine is accounted for by heart-rate reduction, as shown by the neutralisation of the treatment effect after adjustment for change of heart rate at 28 days (HR 0.95, 0.85-1.06, p=0.352).

CONCLUSIONS Two-level strategies that combine an organizational intervention such as ARC and an evidence-based treatment such as MST are promising approaches to implementing effective community-based mental health services. More research is needed to understand how such strategies can be used effectively in a variety of organizational contexts and with other types of evidence-based treatments.", "1_year_count": 5, "label": 1}, {"paper_id": "cf574819260b5014b8f1e4e93c73c5ac18875d4d", "text": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of feeding a diet supplemented with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids on carprofen dosage in dogs with osteoarthritis.

PROCEDURES In all dogs, the dosage of carprofen was standardized over a 3-week period to approximately 4.4 mg/kg/d (2 mg/lb/d), PO. Dogs were then randomly assigned to receive a food supplemented with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids or a control food with low omega-3 fatty acid content, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks later, investigators made decisions regarding increasing or decreasing the carprofen dosage on the basis of investigator assessments of 5 clinical signs and owner assessments of 15 signs.

OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of supplying patient adherence information to primary care providers.   METHODS Patients and providers were members of a health system serving southeast Michigan. Providers (88 intervention; 105 control) and patients (1335 intervention; 1363 control) were randomized together by practice. Patients were age 5 to 56 years, had a diagnosis of asthma, and had existing prescriptions for ICS medication. Adherence was estimated by using prescription and fill data. Unlike clinicians in the control arm, intervention arm providers could view updated ICS adherence information on their patients via electronic prescription software, and further details on patient ICS use could be viewed by selecting that option. The primary outcome was ICS adherence in last 3 months of the study period.   RESULTS At the study end for the intention-to-treat analysis, ICS adherence was not different among patients in the intervention arm compared with those in the control arm (21.3% vs 23.3%, respectively; P = .553).

Genetic, nongenetic, and epigenetic data propose a role of the key metabolic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A) in the development of T2D.   OBJECTIVE Our objective was to investigate gene expression and DNA methylation of PPARGC1A and coregulated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes in LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) subjects during control and high-fat diets. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty young healthy men with LBW and 26 matched NBW controls were studied after 5 d high-fat overfeeding (+50% calories) and after a control diet in a randomized manner. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed and skeletal muscle biopsies excised. DNA methylation and gene expression were measured using bisulfite sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively.   RESULTS When challenged with high-fat overfeeding, LBW subjects developed peripheral insulin resistance and reduced PPARGC1A and OXPHOS (P < 0.05) gene expression. PPARGC1A methylation was significantly higher in LBW subjects (P = 0.0002) during the control diet. However, PPARGC1A methylation increased in only NBW subjects after overfeeding in a reversible manner. DNA methylation of PPARGC1A did not correlate with mRNA expression.   CONCLUSIONS LBW subjects developed peripheral insulin resistance and decreased gene expression of PPARGC1A and OXPHOS genes when challenged with fat overfeeding. The extent to which our finding of a constitutively increased DNA methylation in the PPARGC1A promoter in LBW subjects may contribute needs to be determined.

A large proportion of hypertensive subjects cannot be properly controlled with a single medication. However, no study has yet investigated the potential differing effects of combination therapy depending of the time-of-day of administration. Accordingly, the authors investigated the administration-time-dependent BP-lowering efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine combination. The authors studied 203 hypertensive subjects (92 men/111 women), 56.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5 yrs of age, randomized to receive valsartan (160\u2009mg/day) and amlodipine (5\u2009mg/day) in one of the following four therapeutic schemes: both medications on awakening, both at bedtime, either one administered on awakening and the other at bedtime. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring for 48 consecutive hours before and after 12 wks of treatment. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately determine the beginning and end of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep. BP-lowering efficacy (quantified in terms of reduction of the 48-h mean of systolic/diastolic BP) was highest when both hypertension medications were ingested at bedtime, as compared to any one of the three other tested therapeutic schemes (17.4/13.4\u2009mm Hg reduction with both medications on awakening; 15.1/9.6\u2009mm Hg with valsartan on awakening and amlodipine at bedtime; 18.2/12.3\u2009mm Hg with valsartan at bedtime and amlodipine on awakening; 24.7/13.5\u2009mm Hg with both medications at bedtime; p\u2009<\u2009.018 between groups). The sleep-time relative BP decline was significantly increased towards a more normal dipper pattern only when both medications were jointly ingested at bedtime (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Bedtime dosing of the combination of the two medications also resulted in the largest percentage of controlled subjects among all the assessed therapeutic schemes (p\u2009=\u2009.003 between groups).

The current study aims to present an economic model and cost-effectiveness estimates for aripiprazole compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD who showed an incomplete response to a prospective 8-week trial of antidepressant therapy.   MATERIAL AND METHOD An economic model of MDD treatment was developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes in Thai patients. Efficacy data were derived from a pooled analysis of two studies. A cost-effectiveness analysis was constructed in simulate the impact of treatment outcomes and costs over a 6-week time horizon. The primary outcome of the model was remission of symptoms. Quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) was the secondary outcome. The event probabilities were used to derive the transitional probability used in the model and to calculate the weighted cost of each treatment outcome. Only direct costs were considered. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to test the sensitivity of the model outputs.   RESULTS Treatment with aripiprazole came at the total costs per remission of 30,970 Baht while treatment with placebo came at the total costs per remission of 28,409 Baht. Placebo had lower total costs per QALY than aripiprazole (35,511 Baht vs. 38,713 Baht). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of augmentation with aripiprazole compared with placebo was 2,561 Baht per remission gained and 3,201 Baht per QALY gained. Aripiprazole dominated placebo if the value of transitional probability of remission changed to a value of greater than 0.348 from the base-case value of 0.257. Aripiprazole was more cost-effective than placebo as adjunctive therapy if the unit cost of aripiprazole is more than 48.9% discount.   CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive aripiprazole is not more cost-effective than adjunctive placebo in Thai patients with MDD who showed an inadequate response to at least one prospective antidepressant therapy.

At baseline and after 6\u00a0months, participants performed the tandem gait test (TGT) and filled out a questionnaire evaluating fear of falling. Successful performance in the muscle tests is associated with a significantly lower risk of falls and non-vertebral fractures in elderly patients (successful test performance: TUG\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0s (sec), CRT\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u00a0s, TGT\u00a0\u2265\u00a08 steps). A significant improvement in the performance of the two muscle tests was proved already after 3\u00a0months of treatment with alfacalcidol and further increased by the end of the therapeutic intervention.

In cardiac surgery glutamate has been administered as a putative cardioprotective agent by cardioplegia or intravenous infusion. In the GLUTAMICS trial, in addition to surveillance of clinical neurological injuries, a prespecified subgroup was analyzed with regard to postoperative S-100B levels to detect potential subclinical neurological injury related to glutamate infusion.   METHODS Sixty-nine patients operated on for unstable coronary syndrome were randomized to intravenous infusion of glutamate (n=35) or saline (n=34) perioperatively. Plasma levels of S-100B were obtained on the third postoperative day.   RESULTS S-100B in the glutamate group and the control group were 0.079+/-0.034microg/L and 0.090+/-0.042microg/L respectively (p=0.245). There were no patients with stroke or mortality. Three patients in the control group and two in the glutamate group had postoperative confusion. These patients had significantly elevated S-100B compared with those without confusion (0.132+/-0.047vs 0.081+/-0.036microg/L; p=0.003). Overall, 21 patients had S-100B above reference level (> or =0.10microg/L) and these patients had significantly more calcifications in the ascending aorta on epiaortic scanning.

METHODS We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care. Efficacy end points were percent changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the 6-minute walk test on intention-to-treat analysis. We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications.   RESULTS Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P=0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P=0.17). At 90 days, in the EBV group, as compared with the control group, there were increased rates of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs. 1.1%, P=0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs. 0%, P=0.01). The rate of pneumonia in the target lobe in the EBV group was 4.2% at 12 months. Greater radiographic evidence of emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness was associated with an enhanced response to treatment.   CONCLUSIONS Endobronchial-valve treatment for advanced heterogeneous emphysema induced modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms at the cost of more frequent exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, and hemoptysis after implantation.

Epidemiologic studies have reported that up to 75% of the risk for human essential hypertension is attributable to excess weight. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that excess weight raises blood pressure (BP) and that weight loss is the most effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering BP in obese hypertensive patients. The mechanisms that link excessive weight gain and increased BP are poorly understood, however. Proposed mechanisms include impairment of renalpressure natriuresis, sympathetic nervous system activation, functional and structural renal abnormalities, and activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS). Studies in experimental animals and humans have shown that obesity activates most components of the RAAS. It has been established that the treatment of obese patients with an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor attenuates sodium retention and volume expansion as well as high BP. These findings support the hypothesis that angiotensin II plays a significant role in stimulating renal sodium reabsorption and thus contributes to obesity-induced hypertension. The involvement of aldosterone (ALDO) in sodium retention and hypertension in obesity has only recently been proposed. In a model of chronic dietary-induced obesity in dogs, ALDO blockade decreased glomerular hyperfiltration and sodium retention and attenuated hypertension, indicating that ALDO plays a role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced hypertension. ALDO has also been implicated in the development of certain deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. Some studies have demonstrated that ALDO induces endothelial lesions and cardiac and renal fibrosis, and that these effects can be attenuated by ALDO antagonism. Furthermore, ALDO blockade has been shown to be associated with improved BP control in patients with refractory hypertension, a disorder affecting a population that includes a high percentage of obese individuals. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been designed to specifically evaluate the BP response to ALDO blockade in obese and hypertensive patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The primary goal of the present study was to determine whether ALDO blockade, achieved through the use of the antagonist spironolactone, attenuates hypertension in obese and hypertensive patients with MetS.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "5a1db1b01c5366619f27e6f48ac4e09de69b8a88", "text": "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of topical application of 50 mg penicillin G potassium troches in the treatment of minor recurrent aphthous ulcerations (MiRAU) in a Chinese cohort.

It is likely that, if repair truly exists, it would be preferentially seen in clinically inactive joints from patients treated with drugs with well-known structural efficacy.

Patients and methods Radiographs from patients of the TEMPO trial were scored twice by two readers according to the Sharp\u2013van der Heijde score, blinded to both treatment and true time sequence. Single-joint change scores in erosions were coupled with single-joint swelling scores obtained from clinical examination. Consistency of observed improvement across readers and repeat reads was described, and factors expected to increase the likelihood of occurrence of both worsening and improvement of erosion were tested by generalised estimating equations (GEE) modelling. Results In all of the four independent reads, the mean change in erosion score was statistically significantly negative only in the subgroup of joints with absent or improved swelling, when erosions were present at baseline. Multivariate analysis showed that worsening of the erosion score in a joint was significantly increased if that joint was already damaged at study entry, clinical swelling persisted and methotrexate was used instead of etanercept. Repair was associated with improvement of swelling and use of etanercept (p\u22640.007 for all associations).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to ascertain the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nemonoxacin. We enrolled 46 healthy volunteers and used a once-daily oral-dosing range of 75 to 1,000 mg for 10 days. Additionally, the food effect was evaluated in subjects in the 500-mg cohort. Nemonoxacin was generally safe and well tolerated, with no significant changes in the clinical laboratory tests or electrocardiograms. Adverse effects, including headache, contact dermatitis, and rash, were mild and resolved spontaneously. Nemonoxacin was rapidly absorbed within 2 h postdosing, and generally, a steady state was reached after 3 days.

They were randomized in a double-blinded manner to receive, extended release Venlafaxine 37.5\u2009mg/d, gabapentin 300\u2009mg/d, or placebo for 10 days starting the night before operation. Pain scores were recorded at rest and movement (visual analog scale) at 4, 12, and 24 hours on the first day postoperatively, daily from the second to tenth day postoperatively and visual analog scale in addition to pain character 6 months later. Analgesic requirements were compared between the 3 groups. ResultsPain after movement was reduced by gabapentin from the second to tenth postoperative day and venlafaxine group in the last 3 days but no difference was found between the groups regarding pain during rest. Gabapentin reduced morphine consumed in the first 24 hours postoperatively. The analgesic requirements from the second to tenth days for codeine and paracetamol were reduced in venlafaxine and gabapentin groups compared to the control group.

As researchers seek to fill these gaps in knowledge, it is essential that they validate their methods through use of pilot studies. The following pilot study illustrates how such exploration can lead to unexpected and necessary modification of methods.    The study focused on measurement of dosing accuracy by blind people using insulin pens. The National Federation of the Blind provided in-kind support for the study. The original study design used a common method for measuring dose accuracy: weighing insulin delivered into a small cup. For the pilot, 12 blind staff members of the U.S. National Federation of the Blind received instruction on insulin pen use and delivered doses into a small cup. Audible \u201cclicks\u201d for each dose were counted and recorded by the researchers, and the cups were weighed immediately before and after each dose using a precision balance.    All doses (100%) were dialed correctly according to the click count. However, four doses had greater than 20% error by weight. During the last two of these doses, the principal investigator and research assistant independently noticed a large hanging drop of insulin remaining on the end of the needle. The hanging drop was a source of error for these two doses and may have been an unnoticed source of error for the other two doses.    Measurement error produced by hanging drops is much less likely when sighted people deliver a dose, since they could see and shake off the drop. Blind people do not see the drop, and their dosing may seem inaccurate in comparison. This source of error has no clinical significance; anyone using an insulin pen would inject into subcutaneous tissue, which would not leave a hanging drop on the needle. The error is an artifact of the measurement method.    Because this source of error was discovered in the pilot study, the measurement method for a larger follow-up study was changed to weighing insulin delivered into an injection ball (a rubber ball used to teach injections), which simulates injection into subcutaneous tissue more closely. If this source of error had not been noticed in pilot testing, the results of the larger study would have been artificially biased.    The importance of conducting pilot studies to validate methods with disabled populations cannot be overemphasized. As this pilot study illustrates, a method that is valid in a nondisabled population but not pilot tested with a disabled population could reinforce inaccurate and limiting stereotypes about the true abilities of people with disabilities.", "1_year_count": 2, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "280bf7ac15126ef66b047cb225ae90205bd9d147", "text": "PURPOSE We assessed the prognostic impact of IDH1 R132 mutations and a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the same exon of the IDH1 gene in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) in the context of other prognostic markers.   PATIENTS AND METHODS IDH1 exon four was directly sequenced in 275 CN-AML patients from two subsequent AML multicenter treatment trials and 120 healthy volunteers. Moreover, mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and WT1 were analyzed, and mRNA expression of IDH1 was quantified.   RESULTS IDH1 R132 mutations were found in 10.9% of CN-AML patients. IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was found in 12% of CN-AML patients and 11.7% of healthy volunteers. IDH1 R132 mutations had no impact on prognosis.

Changing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) impacts respiratory muscle load and function and, hence, EAdi. We aimed to evaluate how PEEP affects the breathing pattern and neuroventilatory efficiency during NAVA.   METHODS In 20 adult patients, adequate assist (NAVAal) was first identified based on Paw and tidal volume (Vt) responses to systematic increases in NAVA level while using preset PEEP (PEEPbl). Thereafter, using NAVAal, PEEP was increased to 20 cm water (H(2)O) (PEEPhigh) and then lowered stepwise to 1 cm H(2)O (PEEP1). EAdi, Paw, and Vt were recorded.   RESULTS Median NAVAal was 2.7 (interquartile range, 2.3-3.5) cm H(2)O/muV and was similar to NAVAal identified post hoc by 17 independent physicians (2.5 [2.0-3.4] cm H(2)O/muV; P = NS). Reducing PEEPhigh to PEEP1 increased inspiratory EAdi by 34% (2-67; P = .046) and was associated with an increase in mean Paw above PEEP from 8.5 (6.7-11.4) cm H(2)O to 12.2 (8.8-16.7) cm H(2)O (P = .008), whereas Vt and respiratory rate remained unchanged. The response pattern in Vt/EAdi, indicating changes in neuroventilatory efficiency, differed among patients. Tidal breathing occurred at the lowest EAdi cost in seven patients with PEEP1 or half PEEPbl, in six patients with PEEPbl, and in seven patients with PEEPhigh.   CONCLUSIONS During NAVAal, increasing PEEP reduces respiratory drive. Patients adapt their neuroventilatory efficiency such that the individual ventilatory pattern is preserved over a wide range of PEEP levels. Monitoring Vt/EAdi during PEEP changes allows identification of a PEEP level at which tidal breathing occurs at minimal EAdi cost.

METHODS AND RESULTS Anatomic ablation at the areas of GP in the left atrium was performed in 89 patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory, persistent AF (71 men, 56 +/- 7 years of age). In 29 patients, a second procedure by means of circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation was performed, and 5 of them were subjected to a third circumferential ablation. At 16 +/- 7 months after the final ablation procedure, 53 (59.6%) of the 89 patients were in sinus rhythm in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, 5 (5.6%) patients had permanent AF, and 31 (34.8%) patients had paroxysmal AF.

OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that clarithromycin would improve asthma control in individuals with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma that was not well controlled despite treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids.   METHODS Adults with an Asthma Control Questionnaire score \u22651.5 after a 4-week period of treatment with fluticasone propionate were entered into a PCR-stratified randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of either clarithromycin or placebo, added to fluticasone, on asthma control in individuals with or without lower airway PCR evidence of M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae.   RESULTS A total of 92 participants were randomized. Twelve (13%) subjects demonstrated PCR evidence of M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae in endobronchial biopsies; 80 were PCR-negative for both organisms. In PCR-positive participants, clarithromycin yielded a 0.4\u00a0\u00b1 0.4 unit improvement in the Asthma Control Questionnaire score, with a 0.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.3 unit improvement in those allocated to placebo. This between-group difference of 0.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.5 (P\u00a0= .6) was neither clinically nor statistically significant. In PCR-negative participants, a nonsignificant between-group difference of 0.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.2 units (P\u00a0= .3) was observed.

RESULTS The MTX dosage was significantly higher in patients in whom the swollen joint count and DAS28 were higher. The MTXGlu(4), MTXGlu(5), MTXGlu(3-5), and MTXGlu(1-5) concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high disease activity.

In an analysis of subgroups defined by Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) class, testing was associated with harm in low risk patients (RCRI 0 points: HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.74), but with benefit in patients who were at intermediate risk (RCRI 1-2 points: 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) or high risk (RCRI 3-6 points: 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97). Conclusions Preoperative non-invasive cardiac stress testing is associated with improved one year survival and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery. These benefits principally apply to patients with risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications.", "1_year_count": 15, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "7e6580721224c408fccf75c936b431b3bb139e76", "text": "BACKGROUND Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a mode of mechanical ventilation, which has demonstrated potential benefits in trauma patients. We therefore sought to compare relevant pulmonary data and safety outcomes of this modality to the recommendations of the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network.   METHODS Patients admitted after traumatic injury requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized under a 72-hour waiver of consent to a respiratory protocol for APRV or low tidal volume ventilation (LOVT). Data were collected regarding demographics, Injury Severity Score, oxygenation, ventilation, airway pressure, failure of modality, tracheostomy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator days, length of stay (LOS), pneumothorax, and mortality.   RESULTS Sixty-three patients were enrolled during a 21-month period ending in February 2006. Thirty-one patients were assigned to APRV and 32 to LOVT. Patients were well matched for demographic variables with no differences between groups. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was higher for APRV than LOVT (20.5 \u00b1 5.35 vs. 16.9 \u00b1 7.17) with a p value = 0.027. Outcome variables showed no differences between APRV and LOVT for ventilator days (10.49 days \u00b1 7.23 days vs. 8.00 days \u00b1 4.01 days), ICU LOS (16.47 days \u00b1 12.83 days vs. 14.18 days \u00b1 13.26 days), pneumothorax (0% vs. 3.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia per patient (1.00 \u00b1 0.86 vs. 0.56 \u00b1 0.67), percent receiving tracheostomy (61.3% vs. 65.6%), percent failure of modality (12.9% vs. 15.6%), or percent mortality (6.45% vs. 6.25%).   CONCLUSIONS For patients sustaining significant trauma requiring mechanical ventilation for greater than 72 hours, APRV seems to have a similar safety profile as the LOVT.

To investigate whether posterior and anterior fixation of the vesicourethral anastomosis during robotic radical prostatectomy (RRP) helps to establish continence earlier. Material and methods. Forty-seven consecutive patients undergoing RRP were randomized into two groups. The first group received a typical Van Velthoven vesicourethral anastomosis and the second group a modified anastomosis with posterior and anterior fixation. In this group the posterior fibrous tissues of the sphincter were sutured to the residual Denonvilliers' fascia. The anastomosis with two running sutures started at the 6 o'clock position on the bladder neck and continued upwards. Two-step stitching was done on the upper half of the anastomosis to ensure good stabilization of the bladder: a small portion of urethral stump followed by a deep haemostatic stitch on the plexus. Continence, as measured by patient self-reporting of the number of pads used per 24 h, was assessed 7 weeks after catheter removal, by telephone interview. The use of no pads or one pad was defined as \u201ccontinent\u201d, two pads as \u201cmoderate incontinence\u201d and more than two pads as \u201csevere incontinence\u201d. Results. At catheter removal, more patients in the fixation group were continent than in the Van Velthoven group [9/23 (39%) vs 3/24 (12.5%), p = 0.036]. At 7 weeks, continence was even better in the fixation group [15/23 (65%) vs 8/24 (33%), p = 0. 029]. The mean pad usage was less in the fixation group (1.43 vs 2.25, p = 0.032). Conclusions.

NEST is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial designed to test whether, in neonates requiring ECMO, cooling to 34\u00b0C for the first 48 to 72 hours of their ECMO course leads to improved later health status. Infants allocated to the control group will receive ECMO at 37\u00b0C throughout their course, which is currently standard practice around the world. Health status of both groups will be assessed formally at 2 years corrected age.Methods/DesignAll infants recruited to the study will be cared for in one of the four United Kingdom (UK) ECMO centres. Babies who are thought to be eligible will be assessed by the treating clinician who will confirm eligibility, ensure that consent has been obtained and then randomise the baby using a web based system, based at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) Clinical Trials Unit. Trial registration.Babies allocated ECMO without cooling will receive ECMO at 37\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C. Babies allocated ECMO with cooling will be managed at 34\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C for up to 72 hours from the start of their ECMO run. The minimum duration of cooling will be 48 hours. Rewarming (to 37\u00b0C) will occur at a rate of no more than 0.5\u00b0C per hour. All other aspects of ECMO management will be identical. Primary outcome: Cognitive score from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III) at age of 2 years (24 - 27 months).DiscussionFor the primary analysis, children will be analysed in the groups to which they are assigned, comparing the outcome of all babies allocated to \"ECMO with cooling\" with all those allocated to \"ECMO\" alone, regardless of deviation from the protocol or treatment received. For the primary outcome the analysis will compare the mean scores for each group of surviving babies. The rationale for this choice of primary analysis is to give a fair representation of the average ability of assessable children, accepting the limitation that excluding deaths might impose.The consistency of the effect of cooling on the group of babies recruited to the trial will be explored to see whether cooling is of particular help, or not, to specific subgroups of infants, using the statistical test of interaction.

However, previous studies indicate that low doses of theophylline enhance the activity of a key corticosteroid-associated corepressor protein, histone deacetylase (HDAC)2, which is reduced in COPD. This may account, at least in part, for the relative corticosteroid resistance. Thus, combination therapy with an ICS and low-dose theophylline may be of benefit in the treatment of COPD.   METHODS To test the hypothesis that ICS and theophylline have a greater therapeutic effect than theophylline alone, 30 patients with COPD were treated with placebo theophylline capsules and either inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) (500 microg bid) or inhaled placebo for 4 weeks in a double-dummy, randomized, double-blind, parallel study. After a 2-week washout, patients were given active theophylline capsules (plasma level of 8.8-12.4 mg/L).   RESULTS In an across-arm comparison, combination treatment with FP and theophylline did not reduce total sputum neutrophils but significantly reduced total sputum eosinophils (P < .05). Additional across-arm comparisons suggest a further reduction in percentage sputum neutrophils and sputum chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8/IL-8 (P < .05). Furthermore, within-arm observational data also demonstrated increases in forced midexpiratory flow rate and FEV(1)% predicted (P < .05) following combination treatment only. In an open-label study, low-dose theophylline when added to inhaled FP increased total HDAC activity in peripheral blood monocytes ninefold (P < .01) compared with FP alone from the same patients with COPD.   CONCLUSIONS Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and low-dose theophylline may attenuate airway inflammation in patients with COPD.

If such an effect also occurs in man, this class of inhibitors could become a new treatment for ischaemia in patients with angina pectoris. We ascertained whether high-dose allopurinol prolongs exercise capability in patients with chronic stable angina. Methods 65 patients (aged 18\u201385 years) with angiographically documented coronary artery disease, a positive exercise tolerance test, and stable chronic angina pectoris (for at least 2 months) were recruited into a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study in a hospital and two infirmaries in the UK. We used computer-generated randomisation to assign patients to allopurinol (600 mg per day) or placebo for 6 weeks before crossover. Our primary endpoint was the time to ST depression, and the secondary endpoints were total exercise time and time to chest pain. We did a completed case analysis. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 82040078. Findings In the first treatment period, 31 patients were allocated to allopurinol and 28 were analysed, and 34 were allocated to placebo and 32 were analysed. In the second period, all 60 patients were analysed. Allopurinol increased the median time to ST depression to 298 s (IQR 211\u2013408) from a baseline of 232 s (182\u2013380), and placebo increased it to 249 s (200\u2013375; p=0\u00b70002). The point estimate (absolute difference between allopurinol and placebo) was 43 s (95% CI 31\u201358). Allopurinol increased median total exercise time to 393 s (IQR 280\u2013519) from a baseline of 301 s (251\u2013447), and placebo increased it to 307 s (232\u2013430; p=0\u00b70003); the point estimate was 58 s (95% CI 45\u201377).

Unexpectedly, an increase in the plasma concentration of tumor nuclear factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was observed in the bilberry group.

Methods:The pharmacokinetics (plasma concentrations of l-dopa and 3-O-methyldopa [3-OMD]) and motor effects (global score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III) of a single dose of l-dopa (plus the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor 1:4) were determined in 14 patients with advanced PD. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to Hoehn and Yahr scale (stages 2 and 3). In 1 patient with severe dyskinesias and fluctuations, pk/pd of l-dopa were evaluated before and after coadministration of tolcapone at 100 mg 2 times daily for 1 month. The pk/pd analysis was based on an estimate of the maximal response model with a semiparametric approach to effect site equilibrium. Results:The highest levels of l-dopa and 3-OMD were observed in patients with stage 3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale. We showed differences in the pk/pd parameters after coadministration of tolcapone in 1 patient as well as the clinical improvement.Univariate analysis showed some significant correlations (P < 0.05) between l-dopa pk/pd parameters and patients' age, duration of l-dopa treatment, and duration of the disease. Multivariate analysis adjusted for patients' age, sex, duration of the disease, and Hoehn and Yahr stage showed that presence of diphasic (dyskinesia-improvement-dyskinesia [DID]) dyskinesias was the only independent predictor of larger threshold level - EC50 (mean concentration at half maximal effect) of l-dopa (P = 0.034). Conclusions:The motor complications during long treatment therapy in patients with advanced PD especially with stage 3 Hoehn and Yahr scale were correlated to the higher plasma concentrations of l-dopa. In the presented study, patients with motor complications, especially with DID dyskinesias, exhibited a larger threshold level (EC50). The clinical improvement of a patient who received l-dopa and tolcapone can be explained by tolcapone-induced changes of peripheral and central l-dopa pharmacokinetics, which led to a decrease of l-dopa EC50 and 3-OMD concentrations.

Volume regression parameters were correlated with local control, disease-specific, and overall survival.   RESULTS Residual tumor volume, slope, and area under the regression curve correlated significantly with local control and survival.

We conducted a simulation study, which confirmed analysis using all members of a sibship is statistically more powerful than methods based on cross\u2010sectional analysis or using subsets of sib\u2010pairs. Second, we propose a simple permutation approach to avoid errors of inference due to the within\u2010sibship correlation of any errors in haplotype assignment. These methods were applied to investigate the association between mammographic density (MD), a continuously distributed and heritable risk factor for breast cancer, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes from the VDR gene using data from a study of 430 twins and sisters.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of this intervention on bone and muscle in children with CP. Methods Thirty-one children with CP ages 6 to 12 years (mean 9.4, SD 1.4) stood on a vibrating platform (30Hz, 0.3 g peak acceleration) at home for 10 min/d for 6 months and on the floor without the platform for another 6 months. The order of vibration and standing was randomized, and outcomes were measured at 0, 6, and 12 months. The outcome measures included computed tomography measurements of vertebral cancellous bone density (CBD) and cross-sectional area, CBD of the proximal tibia, geometric properties of the tibial diaphysis, and dynamometer measurements of plantarflexor strength. They were assessed using mixed model linear regression and Pearson correlation. Results The main difference between vibration and standing was that there was a greater increase in the cortical bone properties (cortical bone area and moments of inertia) during the vibration period (all P's\u2a7d0.03). There was no difference in cancellous bone or muscle between vibration and standing (all P's>0.10) and no correlation between compliance and outcome (all r's<0.27; all P's>0.15). The results did not depend on the order of treatment (P>0.43) and were similar for children in gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) 1 to 2 and GMFCS 3 to 4. Conclusions The primary benefit of the vibration intervention in children with CP was to the cortical bone in the appendicular skeleton. Increased cortical bone area and the structural (strength) properties could translate into a decreased risk of long bone fractures in some patients. More research is needed to corroborate these findings, to elucidate the mechanisms of the intervention, and to determine the most effective age and duration of the treatment.

Using generalized estimating equations, we modeled associations of each potential predictor with opioid use at 12 and 24 months. At baseline, 42% of participants reported opioid use. Of these participants, 25% reported continued use at 12 months and 21% reported use at 24 months. In adjusted models, smoking (RR = 1.9, P < .001 at 12 months; RR = 1.5, P = .043 at 24 months) and nonsurgical treatment (RR = 1.7, P < .001 at 12 months; RR = 1.8, P = .003 at 24 months) predicted long-term opioid continuation.

Group A had a longer median disease duration than group B (0.5 vs 0.4 years, p\u200a=\u200a0.016), a higher mean DAS28 (6.1 vs 5.7, p<0.001), more rheumatoid factor-positive patients (66% vs 42%, p<0.001) and more patients with erosions (71% vs 53%, p<0.001). After 1 year, the HAQ improvement was 0.7 vs 0.5 (p\u200a=\u200a0.029), and the percentage in remission (DAS28 <2.6) 31% vs 18% (p<0.005) in groups A and B, respectively.

DESIGN Retrospective multicenter analysis in patients presenting at the cardiology emergency room.   SETTING Patient inclusion between January 1 and March 31, 2006.   PATIENTS A total of 2161 patients were admitted, of which 910 patients (42%) presented with chest pain. Analysis was performed in 880 cases (96.7%).   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and death, within 6 weeks after presentation, together called major adverse cardiac events.

Insights into the specific characteristics of those who do succeed are needed. One aim was to investigate whether a selection of correlates of general health perception creates cluster typologies in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Another was to evaluate whether magnitude of change in health status differs between clusters after a 1-year coaching intervention targeting health-enhancing physical activity. Method.\u2003Two hundred and twenty-eight patients (74% women, mean age 56 years, disease duration 1 year) with RA, from 10 rheumatology clinics in Sweden, participated. The patients were assigned at random to intervention or control. The intervention group underwent 1 year of coaching to adopt health-enhancing physical activity (moderately intensive, 30\u2009min/day, > 4 days/week). The cluster analysis included five correlates of general health perception: disease activity; pain; timed standing; activity limitation; and self-reported physical activity. The primary outcome of the coaching intervention was self-reported health status. Results.\u2003One-hundred and forty-six patients were eligible for inclusion in the cluster analysis. The eight clusters identified both at baseline and post interventions were operationalized according to the number of cluster variables affected: less (LE) affected or more (MO) affected, respectively.

BACKGROUND In patients with stable ischemic heart disease, ranolazine increases exercise duration and reduces maximal ST-segment depression while exerting minimal effects on heart rate and blood pressure, although its mechanism of action during exercise has not been investigated.   METHODS Patients with stable ischemic heart disease (n = 191) were randomly allocated to a 4-period, double-blind, balanced Latin square crossover study to receive placebo, and ranolazine 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg twice daily (bid) for 1 week each. Exercise treadmill tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. The RPP and ST-segment depression were assessed before starting exercise, at each stage of exercise, and at maximal exercise.   RESULTS Compared with placebo, ranolazine produced a dose-dependent reduction in ST-segment depression that became more marked as exercise-induced ischemia became more pronounced, associated with clinically minor decreases in heart rate and blood pressure. At 12-min exercise, the amount of ST-segment depression compared with placebo and controlled for RPP was reduced by 22.3% on ranolazine 500 mg bid (p = 0.137), by 35.4% on 1,000 mg bid (p = 0.005), and by 45.8% on 1,500 mg bid (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that the anorexic hormone oxyntomodulin (OXM) might contribute to the marked weight reduction and the rapid improvement in glucose metabolism observed in morbidly obese diabetic patients after GBP.   METHODS Twenty obese women with type 2 diabetes were studied before and 1 month after GBP (n=10) or after a diet-induced equivalent weight loss (n=10). Patients from both groups were matched for age, body weight, body mass index, and diabetes duration and control. OXM concentrations were measured during a 50-g oral glucose challenge before and after weight loss.   RESULTS At baseline, OXM levels (fasting and stimulated values) were indistinguishable between the GBP and the diet group. However, OXM levels rose remarkably in response to an oral glucose load more than 2-fold (peak, 5.25+/-1.31 to13.8+/-16.2 pmol/liter; P=0.025) after GBP but not after diet. The peak of OXM after glucose was significantly correlated with glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY3-36.   CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the observed changes in OXM primarily occur in response to GBP and not as a consequence of weight loss. These changes were observed early after surgery and occurred in parallel with previously reported increases in incretins and peptide YY. We speculate that the combination of gut hormone changes is essential for the improved glucose homeostasis and may partially explain the success of this surgery on diabetes resolution and weight loss.", "1_year_count": 18, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "ff01d8037b2f5559b128876368c2c392774a5204", "text": "Mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL)-partial tandem duplications (PTDs) are found in 3-5% of adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and are associated with poor prognosis. In adult AML, MLL-PTD is only detected in patients with trisomy 11 or internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD). To date, studies in paediatric AML are scarce, and reported large differences in the frequency of MLL-PTD, frequently utilising mRNA RT-PCR only to detect MLL-PTDs. We studied the frequency of MLL-PTD in a large cohort of paediatric AML (n=276) and the results from two different methods, i.e. mRNA RT-PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a method designed to detect copy number differences of specific DNA sequences. In some patients with an MLL-rearrangement, MLL-PTD transcripts were detected, but were not confirmed by DNA-MLPA, indicating that DNA-MLPA can more accurately detect MLL-PTD compared to mRNA RT-PCR. In paediatric AML, MLL-PTD was detected in 7/276 patients (2.5%). One case had a trisomy 11, while the others had normal cytogenetics. Furthermore 4 of the 7 patients revealed a FLT3-ITD, which was significantly higher compared with the other AML cases (p=0.016). In conclusion, using DNA-MLPA as a novel screenings technique in combination with mRNA RT-PCR a low frequency of MLL-PTD in paediatric AML was found.

The timing of procedural steps was recorded. We then explored the safety and feasibility of repeated femoral artery MOB injections beyond the occlusion every time the clot was crossed in 17 patients. Pre- and postocclusion flow was continuously monitored with TCD. RESULTS: We studied 60 patients (mean age, 70 \u00b1 11 years; median NIHSS score, 20; IR, 18\u201321).

RESULTS Nitrates were given to 947/1048 (90.4%) patients, diuretics to 934/1049 (89.0%) patients and opiates to 541/1052 patients (51.4%). Adjusted analysis showed that opiate treatment was associated with less improvement in acidosis [difference in improvement in pH -0.022, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.014 to -0.030, P < 0.001], but no difference in mortality or improvement in respiratory distress. We found no evidence that nitrate or diuretic use were associated with any difference in mortality, improvement in acidosis or respiratory distress.

INTRODUCTION: Many reasons exist for non-adherence to medical regimens, and one of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls. METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n\u200a=\u200a354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into two groups: a) \u201cuncomplicated\u201d \u2013 hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) \u201ccomplicated\u201d - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic \u2265110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities.

We evaluated the hypothesis that in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and activated cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), lipophilic ACE inhibitors with high affinity for ACE (perindopril and quinapril) will cause marked blockade of cardiac angiotensin (Ang) II and aldosterone generation, but not a hydrophilic ACE inhibitor with low affinity for ACE (lisinopril).   METHODS Patients were randomized to receive perindopril (8 mg/day), quinapril (40 mg/day), or lisinopril (20 mg/day) for 3-4 weeks before cardiac catheterization. The coronary sinus-aortic root gradients for Ang I and II, and aldosterone were determined.   RESULTS A total of 19 patients completed the study. Compared to a healthy control group, all three ACE inhibitors decreased circulating Ang II and aldosterone to a similar extent. There were only minor differences between the three ACE inhibitors for the Ang II gradient between the coronary sinus and aortic root. The gradient for aldosterone tended to be positive in the quinapril group and absent/negative in the lisinopril and perindopril groups. Despite the lowest pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), gradients between the coronary sinus and aortic root for Ang II and aldosterone were actually the highest in the quinapril group.

A safe, effective, and expedient method for venous anastomosis minimizes flap ischemia time, is easier on the surgical team, and saves costly operating room time. The authors report on their experience using the Synovis microvascular anastomotic coupling device in 1000 consecutive venous anastomoses in free flap breast reconstruction. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 1000 consecutive venous anastomoses that were performed using the microvascular anastomotic coupler between July of 2002 and July of 2008. Data were obtained on flap type, recipient vessel, coupler size, incidence of venous thrombosis, timing of venous thrombosis, and morbidity as a result of venous thrombosis. Results: All anastomoses were performed in an end-to-end fashion. There were 460 unilateral cases and 270 bilateral cases of breast reconstruction. Flap types included muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous, deep inferior epigastric perforator, superficial inferior epigastric artery, superior gluteal artery perforator, and inferior gluteal artery perforator. The vast majority of the recipient vessels were the internal mammary or thoracodorsal vessels. Most of the couplers that were used were either 3 or 2.5 mm in diameter. Overall, there were six instances of venous thrombosis (rate of 0.6 percent). There were no total flap losses due to venous thrombosis in this series, although two patients had partial flap necrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study protocol was approved by the local institutional ethic board. Ten consecutive patients (eight men, two women; mean age 60.5 \u00b1 8.5 years) with Stage III multiple myeloma were prospectively included. MRI was performed at baseline, as well as 3 and 8 weeks after onset of antiangiogenic therapy. Functional MRI data were compared with clinical outcome and conventional lesion size and signal-intensity measurements. Differences between baseline and follow-up values for ASL-MRI and DWI-MRI were assessed using a paired Student t-test.   RESULTS Nine patients responded well to therapy, whereas one patient was classified a nonresponder. Temporary changes in signal intensity between baseline and follow-up examinations were inconsistent on T1-weighted (w) and T2w images. Likewise, determination of lesion size at follow-up proved unreliable. ASL showed a marked decrease in perfusion from baseline (251 \u00b1 159 mL/(min*100g)) to follow-up at 3 weeks (115 \u00b1 85 mL/(min*100g), P = .01) and 8 weeks (101 \u00b1 90 mL/(min*100g, P = .01), respectively.

The close interactions of these systems with the physical world places events as the major building blocks for the realization of CPS. More specifically, the system components and design principles should be revisited with a strictly event-based approach. In this paper, a concept lattice-based event model for CPS is introduced. Under this model, a CPS event is uniformly represented by three components: event type, its internal attributes, and its external attributes. The internal and external attributes together characterize the type, spatiotemporal properties of the event as well as the components that observe it. A set of event composition rules are defined where the CPS event composition is based on a CPS concept lattice. The resulting event model can be used both as an offline analysis tool as well as a run-time implementation model due to its distributed nature. A real-life smart home example is used to illustrate the proposed event model. To this end, a CPS event simulator is implemented to evaluate the developed event model and compare with the existing Java implementation of the smart home application. The comparison result shows that the event model provides several advantages in terms of flexibility, QoS support, and complexity.

METHODSWe conducted a multicenter cross-sectional and longitudinal study, identifying and recruiting 65 infants with metopic synostosis before their corrective surgery. We obtained computed tomography images for 49 infants and measured the presurgical TSI, a 3-dimensional outline-based cranial shape descriptor. We evaluated neurodevelopment by administering the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, and the Preschool Language Scale, Third Edition, before surgery and at 18 and 36 months of age. We fit linear regression models to estimate associations between test scores and TSI values adjusted for age at testing and race/ethnicity. We fit logistic regression models to estimate whether the odds of developmental delay were increased among children with more severe trigonocephaly. RESULTSWe observed little adjusted association between neurodevelopmental test scores and TSI values, and no associations that persisted at 3 years. Trigonocephaly was less severe among children referred at older ages. CONCLUSIONWe observed little evidence of an association between the severity of trigonocephaly among metopic synostosis patients and their neurodevelopmental test scores. Detecting such a relationship with precision may require larger sample sizes or alternative phenotypic quantifiers.

Methods: After an 8-week run-in period, the experimental group were assigned to treatment with AL-TENS, whereas the control group did not receive AL-TENS. A total of 43 children with asthma were recruited from a hospital and an elementary school. All the cases had been diagnosed as having asthma by physicians. The outcome measures included pulmonary function tests (PFTs), heart rate turbulence (HRT), heart rate variability (HRV), and pediatric asthma quality-of-life questionnaire (PAQLQ). Results: After 8 weeks of AL-TENS, there were no significant differences on forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and peak expiratory flows (PEFs) between the two groups. The HRT is the physiological, biphasic response of the sinus node to premature ventricular contractions.

In these patients bolus tenecteplase has the potential to provide an effective and safe thrombolysis.   METHODS We evaluated the effect of tenecteplase on right ventricle dysfunction (RVD) assessed by echocardiography in hemodynamically stable patients with PE in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. RVD was defined as right/left ventricle end-diastolic dimension ratio >1 in the apical 4-chamber view. Patients were randomized to receive weight-adjusted single-bolus tenecteplase or placebo. All patients received unfractionated heparin. Reduction of RVD at 24 hours was the primary efficacy end-point and was evaluated by an independent committee unaware of treatment allocation.   RESULTS Overall, 58 patients were randomized. Echocardiograms were adequate for efficacy analysis in 51 patients, 23 randomized to tenecteplase and 28 to placebo. The reduction of right to left ventricle end-diastolic dimension ratio at 24 hours was 0.31+/-0.08 in patients randomized to tenecteplase as compared to 0.10+/-0.07 in patients randomized to placebo (p=0.04). One patient randomized to tenecteplase suffered a clinical event (recurrent pulmonary embolism) in comparison to three patients randomized to placebo (1 recurrent pulmonary embolism; 1 clinical deterioration and 1 non pulmonary embolism-related death). Two non fatal major bleedings occurred with tenecteplase (1 intracranial) and one with placebo.   CONCLUSION In hemodynamically stable patients with PE, treatment with single bolus tenecteplase is feasible at the same dosages used for acute myocardial infarction and is associated with reduction of RVD at 24 hours.

Serum galactomannan was assayed twice weekly for 60 days, then at least weekly until day 100. Positive galactomannan or suggestive signs triggered mandatory evaluation for IFI. The primary endpoint was freedom from IFI or death (fungal-free survival; FFS) at 180 days. Despite trends to fewer IFIs (7.3% vs 11.2%; P = .12), Aspergillus infections (9 vs 17; P = .09), and less frequent empiric antifungal therapy (24.1% vs 30.2%, P = .11) with voriconazole, FFS rates (75% vs 78%; P = .49) at 180 days were similar with fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. Relapse-free and overall survival and the incidence of severe adverse events were also similar. This study demonstrates that in the context of intensive monitoring and structured empiric antifungal therapy, 6-month FFS and overall survival did not differ in allogeneic HCT recipients given prophylactic fluconazole or voriconazole.

The aim of this study was to develop a HRQOL questionnaire module to supplement the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30 for older (>70years) patients with cancer.   METHODS Phases 1-3 were conducted in seven countries following modified EORTC Quality of Life Group guidelines for module development. Phase 1: potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a questionnaire survey of 17 multi-disciplinary health professionals and two rounds of qualitative interviews. The first round included 9 patients aged >70. The second round was a comparative series of interviews with 49 patients >70years with a range of cancer diagnoses and 40 patients aged 50-69years matched for gender and disease site. In Phase 2 the issues were formulated into a long provisional item list. This was administered in Phase 3 together with the QLQ-C30 to two further groups of cancer patients aged >70 (n=97) or 50-69years (n=85) to determine the importance, relevance and acceptability of each item. Redundant and duplicate items were removed; issues specific to the older group were selected for the final questionnaire.   RESULTS In Phase 1, 75 issues were identified. These were reduced in Phase 2 to create a 45 item provisional list. Phase 3 testing of the provisional list led to the selection of 15 items with good range of response, high scores of importance and relevance in the older patients. This resulted in the EORTC QLQ-ELD15, containing five conceptually coherent scales (functional independence, relationships with family and friends, worries about the future, autonomy and burden of illness).

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to reevaluate, retest PCA3, and rebiopsy men with an initial PCA3 \u2265 100 and no PCa detected and compare the results with a random cohort of men with an initial PCA3<100.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We invited men 63-75 yr of age with a PCA3 \u2265100 for retesting and a control group with an initial PCA3 < 100 to participate in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, section Rotterdam.   INTERVENTIONS Blood and urine sampling were used to determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PCA3. Prostate biopsies were performed if the PSA was \u22652.5 ng/ml and/or the PCA3 score was \u2265 35.   MEASUREMENTS We correlated the initial and reevaluated PCA3 scores. Our assessment of the PPV after rebiopsy was based on the newly determined PCA3 score.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS After a mean study period of 19 mo, more cases of PCa were detected in rebiopsied men with initial PCA3 scores \u2265 100 than in the controls with PCA3 scores < 100 (30.0% vs 18.8%). Combining initial and rebiopsy data resulted in a PPV of 52.2% in men with PCA3 \u2265 100. Over time, changes in PSA and PCA3 levels were quite different.

The objective of this research was to determine the effect that changes in labrum thickness and modulus have on strains in the labrum and glenohumeral capsule during a simulated physical examination for anterior instability. A labrum was incorporated into a validated, subject-specific finite element model of the glenohumeral joint, and experimental kinematics were applied simulating application of an anterior load at 0 deg, 30 deg, and 60 deg of external rotation and 60 deg of glenohumeral abduction. The radial thickness of the labrum was varied to simulate thinning tissue, and the tensile modulus of the labrum was varied to simulate degenerating tissue. At 60 deg of external rotation, a thinning labrum increased the average and peak strains in the labrum, particularly in the labrum regions of the axillary pouch (increased 10.5% average strain) and anterior band (increased 7.5% average strain). These results suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between age-related decreases in labrum thickness and increases in labrum pathology. A degenerating labrum also increased the average and peak strains in the labrum, particularly in the labrum regions of the axillary pouch (increased 15.5% strain) and anterior band (increased 10.4% strain). This supports the concept that age-related labrum pathology may result from tissue degeneration. This work suggests that a shift in capsule reparative techniques may be needed in order to include the labrum, especially as activity levels in the aging population continue to increase.

Methods: One hundred fifteen patients with newly diagnosed HL were prospectively included in the study. All underwent standard ABVD therapy followed by consolidation radiotherapy in cases of bulky disease. After 2 cycles of ABVD, the patients were evaluated with PET (PET2).

HM and conventional patients were similar (age, 63.3\u00b112.8 versus 64.0\u00b112.1 years; 72.0% versus 73.1% male; New York Heart Association II class, 55.9% versus 60.4%; left ventricular ejection fraction, 29.0\u00b110.7% versus 28.5\u00b19.8%; coronary artery disease, 64.8% versus 71.7%; primary prevention, 72.2% versus 73.8%; DDD devices, 57.8% versus 56.6%). Four patients crossed over from conventional to HM because of advisories. Scheduled checks were more successfully accomplished in HM (92.7% versus 89.2% in conventional, P<0.001). Sixty-two device-related events (53 in HM versus 9 in conventional) were observed in 46 patients (40 [4.4%] in HM versus 6 [1.39%] in conventional, P=0.004). Forty-seven percent were asymptomatic. HM detected generator and lead problems earlier (HM versus conventional: median, 1 versus 5 days; P=0.05). A total of 20 device problems (eg, lead fracture, elective replacement indicators) requiring surgical revision (0.012 per patient-year) were found, 15 in HM and 5 in the conventional groups. Other events were managed nonsurgically (eg, reprogramming, initiation of antiarrhythmics). Conclusions\u2014ICD lead and generator malfunction was infrequent and often asymptomatic. Only a minority of detected events required surgical intervention. Automatic HM enhanced discovery, permitted prompt detection, and facilitated management decisions. Longitudinal parameter trending, with component function evaluated daily by remote monitoring, may enable long-term performance assessment.

METHODS A repeated-measures, within-subjects design was used, and 40 adult patients participated. Data collection was completed during 2 test periods: (1) while patients were awake, before the induction of anesthesia (first test period); and (2) after the induction of anesthesia, while patients remained under the effects of anesthesia (second test period).

RESULTS Increased rSO\u2082 values (P < .001) were acquired during nociceptive procedures in both test periods. No significant associations were evident between rSO\u2082, pain behaviors, and the patient's self-report of pain intensity, but this may be attributable to a low range of variability.

However, it remains unsettled which MR imaging modalities offer the highest diagnostic accuracy. We evaluated the accuracy of a combined, dynamic (1.5 seconds per dataset) and static (voxel size, 1.1 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 1.5 mm), contrast-enhanced MRV method (combo-4D MRV) relative to other established MR/MRV modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 39 patients with CVT (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 19) underwent combo-4D MRV, 2D TOF MRV, GRE imaging, and T2W imaging. For these modalities, diagnostic accuracy (ROCs) for CVT affecting 53 out of 234 predefined venous segments was determined. Sensitivity and specificity were separately calculated for different stages of CVT (acute/subacute/chronic). RESULTS: Combo-4D MRV showed the highest accuracy (AUC, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97\u20131.0]; sensitivity, 97% [84%\u2013100%]) for thrombosed dural sinuses. For all thrombosed segments including cortical veins, its sensitivity was best (76% [64%\u201384%]; AUC, 0.92 [0.88\u20130.96]), followed by TOF MRV (72% [59%\u201381%]; AUC, 0.93 [0.88\u20130.97]). Even for chronic CVT, it showed a relatively high sensitivity of 67% (30%\u201390%). For thrombosed cortical veins alone, GRE images achieved the highest sensitivity (66% [46%\u201381%]; AUC, 0.88 [0.78\u20130.97]). Specificities of all modalities ranged from 96% to 99%.

Methods and Results\u2014 The primary end points were overall mortality, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or refractory angina that required revascularization. All data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. At a single institution, 611 patients were randomly assigned to CABG (n=203), PCI (n=205), or MT (n=203). The 10-year survival rates were 74.9% with CABG, 75.1% with PCI, and 69% with MT (P=0.089). The 10-year rates of myocardial infarction were 10.3% with CABG, 13.3% with PCI, and 20.7% with MT (P<0.010). The 10-year rates of additional revascularizations were 7.4% with CABG, 41.9% with PCI, and 39.4% with MT (P<0.001). Relative to the composite end point, Cox regression analysis showed a higher incidence of primary events in MT than in CABG (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidence interval 1.78 to 3.11) and in PCI than in CABG (hazard ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.47). Furthermore, 10-year rates of freedom from angina were 64% with CABG, 59% with PCI, and 43% with MT (P<0.001). Conclusions\u2014 Compared with CABG, MT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction, a higher rate of additional revascularization, a higher incidence of cardiac death, and consequently a 2.29-fold increased risk of combined events. PCI was associated with an increased need for further revascularization, a higher incidence of myocardial infarction, and a 1.46-fold increased risk of combined events compared with CABG. Additionally, CABG was better than MT at eliminating anginal symptoms. Clinical Trial Registration Information\u2014 URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com.

Experimental Design: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201+ disease\u2013free melanoma patients were randomized to the PMED or i.m. arm, receiving eight vaccinations over 4 months. Patients received 4 \u03bcg or 2,000 \u03bcg per injection, respectively, of mouse gp100 DNA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected, cultured with gp100 peptides, and analyzed by tetramer and intracellular cytokine staining for responses to HLA-A*0201\u2013restricted gp100 epitopes [gp100209-217 (ITDQVPFSV) and gp100280-288 (YLEPGPVTA)]. Results: Twenty-seven patients with stage IIB-IV melanoma were analyzable for immune response. The only common toxicity was grade 1 injection site reaction in nine patients with no intergroup difference, and one dose-limiting toxicity of acute hypersensitivity occurred in a PMED patient with undiagnosed gold allergy. Four of 27 patients produced gp100 tetramer+CD8+ T cells, all carrying the CCR7loCD45RAlo effector-memory phenotype. Five of 27 patients generated IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells, one who was also tetramer-positive. Overall, vaccination induced a response in 30% of patients, which was not significantly associated with study arm or clinical outcome. However, the PMED group showed a trend toward increased IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T-cell generation (P = 0.07). Conclusion: A comparable efficacy and safety profile was shown between the i.m. and PMED arms, despite a significantly decreased dose of DNA used for PMED injection.

Within our current health care system those with \"mild\" stroke are typically discharged home within days, without further referral to health or rehabilitation services other than advice to see their family physician. Those with mild stroke often have limited access to support from health professionals with stroke-specific knowledge who would typically provide critical information on topics such as secondary stroke prevention, community reintegration, medication counselling and problem solving with regard to specific concerns that arise. Isolation and lack of knowledge may lead to a worsening of health problems including stroke recurrence and unnecessary and costly health care utilization.The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, for individuals who experience a first \"mild\" stroke, of a sustainable, low cost, multimodal support intervention (comprising information, education and telephone support) - \"WE CALL\" compared to a passive intervention (providing the name and phone number of a resource person available if they feel the need to) - \"YOU CALL\", on two primary outcomes: unplanned-use of health services for negative events and quality of life.Method/DesignWe will recruit 384 adults who meet inclusion criteria for a first mild stroke across six Canadian sites. Baseline measures will be taken within the first month after stroke onset. Participants will be stratified according to comorbidity level and randomised to one of two groups: YOU CALL or WE CALL. Both interventions will be offered over a six months period. Primary outcomes include unplanned use of heath services for negative event (frequency calendar) and quality of life (EQ-5D and Quality of Life Index). Secondary outcomes include participation level (LIFE-H), depression (Beck Depression Inventory II) and use of health services for health promotion or prevention (frequency calendar). Blind assessors will gather data at mid-intervention, end of intervention and one year follow up.DiscussionIf effective, this multimodal intervention could be delivered in both urban and rural environments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 564 premenopausal women were entered into a randomised study independent of ER status. Using a tissue microarray, AIB1 and ER were analysed by immunohistochemistry.   RESULTS AIB1 scores were obtained from 349 women. High AIB1 correlated to factors of worse prognosis (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Nottingham histological grade 3, and lymph node metastases) and to ER negativity. In the control arm, high AIB1 was a negative prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.02).

From the clinical features, the patients were categorized as having high-risk acute coronary syndrome features or no high-risk features.

Most often, it is induced by a rapid intravenous administration of as much as 30 ml/kg of cold crystalloids. We decided to assess the pre-hospital cooling effectivity of this approach by using a target dose of 15-20 ml/kg of 4\u00b0C cold normal saline in the setting of the physician-staffed Emergency Medical Service. The safety and impact on the clinical outcome have also been analyzed.MethodsWe performed a prospective observational study with a retrospective control group. A total of 40 patients were cooled by an intravenous administration of 15-20 ml/kg of 4\u00b0C cold normal saline during transport to the hospital (TH group). The pre-hospital decrease of tympanic temperature (TT) was analyzed as the primary endpoint. Patients in the control group did not undergo any pre-hospital cooling.ResultsIn the TH group, administration of 12.6 \u00b1 6.4 ml/kg of 4\u00b0C cold normal saline was followed by a pre-hospital decrease of TT of 1.4 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C in 42.8 \u00b1 19.6 min (p < 0.001). The most effective cooling was associated with a transport time duration of 38-60 min and with an infusion of 17 ml/kg of cold saline. In the TH group, a trend toward a reduced need for catecholamines during transport was detected (35.0 vs. 52.5%, p = 0.115). There were no differences in demographic variables, comorbidities, parameters of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in other post-resuscitation characteristics. The coupling of pre-hospital cooling with subsequent in-hospital TH predicted a favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge (OR 4.1, CI95% 1.1-18.2, p = 0.046).ConclusionsPre-hospital induction of TH by the rapid intravenous administration of cold normal saline has been shown to be efficient even with a lower dose of coolant than reported in previous studies.

Whether operator bias exists in visual estimation of TIMI flow grade among patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains uncertain. Hence, we examined this issue in the angiographic substudy of the Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction (APEX-AMI) trial.   METHOD TIMI flow grade of the infarct-related artery was assessed before and after PCI by visual estimation of local investigators (LI) and by an independent core laboratory (CL). We evaluated agreement between the CL and LI and the relationship between post-PCI TIMI flow grade and 90-day outcomes (mortality; death/congestive heart failure/shock).   RESULTS Of 922 patients with independent CL estimation of TIMI flow grade, there was moderate agreement in the pre-PCI assessment (kappa = 0.56) and poor agreement post-PCI (kappa = 0.36); moreover, these disparities were directionally different before versus after PCI. Disagreement between LI and CL occurred in 167 patients pre-PCI (19%) and in 123 (14%) patients post-PCI.

METHODS Between February, 1995, and September, 1999, 329 patients with leukaemia received either PBPCT (n=163) or BMT (n=166) from HLA-identical sibling donors after central randomisation accounting for stratification criteria. Follow-up data were collected via questionnaires from 87% (176 of 202; 84 PBPCT, 92 BMT) patients who survived for more than 3 years (median of 9.3 years) after transplantation. Efficacy analyses included all patients who received treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01020175.   FINDINGS 10-year overall survival was 49.1% for patients who underwent PBPCT and 56.5% for patients who underwent BMT (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60-1.15; p=0.27).

According to outpatient treatment, women were less likely to be treated with beta blockers (19,6% vs 30,2%, P<.001) and antithrombotics (34,1% vs 41,3%, P<.05). Treatment administered in the emergency was similar in both groups, yet women received more frequently digoxin (25,7% vs 17,4%, P<.01). Moreover, women were admitted to the cardiology department less often (8,0% vs 13,8%, P<.01).

Women presenting with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often exhibit low plasma SHBG concentration and are at increased risk of developing GDM. In this study, we investigate whether SHBG levels before conception are predictive of GDM in women with PCOS.   METHODS A total of 50 women with PCOS were enrolled and followed up during pregnancy. Initial endocrine, metabolic and physical features were assessed according to a standardized preconception screening program. At 24-26 weeks of gestational age a 100-g glucose tolerance test was performed to screen for GDM.   RESULTS Of the 50 women, 21 (42%) were diagnosed with GDM by a 100-g glucose tolerance test. Waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and SHBG levels before conception were significantly different between women who did and did not develop GDM. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that SHBG was the most significant predictive parameter for GDM (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.97), without significant contribution of waist circumference and HOMA-IR. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that plasma SHBG (area under the curve 0.86) had the highest predictive value for subsequent development of GDM, however, the limited group size did not allow for calculation of a threshold value of SHBG.   CONCLUSIONS In women with PCOS, preconception SHBG levels are strongly associated with subsequent development of GDM. Regression and ROC analysis show that preconception SHBG levels may be a better predictor for GDM in PCOS women compared with waist circumference or HOMA-IR.

METHODS Twenty-one men with metabolic syndrome ingested daily standardized drinks, with or without 28 g acetogenic fibers (acacia gum and pectin), for 5 weeks in a randomized double-blind crossover controlled study design. Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic (EH) clamps coupled with kinetic studies were performed in the fasting state after treatments.   RESULTS Flatulence was more frequent with fiber treatment.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 78 women enrolled in the HAPO study were recruited for this ancillary study. Venous plasma samples were drawn after an 8- to 10-h fast (time 0) and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after a 75-g glucose challenge, which was performed at 24\u201332 weeks' gestation. Samples were analyzed for plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. Insulin sensitivity was estimated using the established Matsuda and DeFronzo insulin sensitivity index for oral glucose tolerance tests (ISOGTT). Insulin sensitivity was also calculated from two other commonly used indexes of insulin sensitivity (that for homeostasis model assessment [ISHOMA] and that for quantitative insulin sensitivity check index [ISQUICKI]). A new insulin sensitivity index was calculated using the glucose and C-peptide concentrations at 0 and 60 min to derive ISHOMA C-pep, ISQUICKI C-pep, and ISOGTT C-pep. These indexes were then correlated with insulin sensitivity estimated from the ISOGTT. RESULTS The strongest correlation with the ISOGTT was obtained for ISOGTT C-pep (r = 0.792, P < 0.001). Further, the correlations of ISHOMA C-pep and ISQUICKI C-pep with ISOGTT were also significant (r = 0.676, P < 0.001 and r = 0.707, P < 0.001, respectively).

BACKGROUND The SXscore has been shown to be an effective predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with multivessel disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.   METHODS The SXscore was prospectively collected in 1,397 of the 1,707 patients enrolled in the LEADERS trial (patients after surgical revascularization were excluded). Post hoc analysis was performed by stratifying clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up, according to 1 of 3 SXscore tertiles.   RESULTS The 1,397 patients were divided into tertiles based on the SXscore in the following fashion: SXscore<or=8 (SXlow) (n=464), SXscore>8 and <or=16 (SXmid) (n=472), and SXscore>16 (SXhigh) (n=461). At 1-year follow-up, there was a significantly lower number of patients with major cardiac event-free survival in the highest tertile of SXscore (SXlow=92.2%, SXmid=91.1%, and SXhigh=84.6%; p<0.001).

The sample consisted of 203 adults with epilepsy. Reliability was tested both by assessing the internal consistency and by the test-retest method. Construct validity was assessed by factor analysis, multitrait-scaling analysis and method of known-groups validation. This was achieved by assessing the relationship between scales and external measures (socio-demographic characteristics, seizure severity and etiology of epilepsy). Criterion validity was assessed by correlation analysis between QOLIE-31 and Short form 36 health survey (SF-36) and Neurotoxicity scale-II.   RESULTS The domains showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.94). Test-retest reliability for Overall test score was 0.83 (Pearson's coefficient) indicating temporal stability.

Standard treatment is failing to achieve required correction of blood glucose in many patients. Therefore, there is a need for investigating potential hypoglycemic drugs or herbs to improve glycemic control in diabetic patients. Nigella sativa seeds were used as an adjuvant therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 added to their anti-diabetic medications. A total of 94 patient were recruited and divided randomly into three dose groups. Capsules containing Nigella sativa were administered orally in a dose of 1, 2 and 3 gm/day for three months. The effect of Nigella sativa on the glycemic control was assessed through measurement of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose level 2 hours postprandially (2 hPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Serum C-peptide and changes in body weight were also measured. Insulin resistance and beta-cell function were calculated usin the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2). Nigella sativa at a dose of 2 gm/day caused significant reductions in FBG, 2hPG, and HbA1 without significant change in body weight. Fasting blood glucose was reduced by an average of 45, 62 and 56 mg/dl at 4, 8 and 12 weeks respectively. HbAlC was reduced by 1.52% at the end of the 12 weeks of treatment (P<0.0001). Insulin resistance calculated by HOMA2 was reduced significantly (P<0.01), while B-cell function was increased (P<0.02) at 12 weeks of treatment. The use of Nigella sativa in a dose of 1 gm/day also showed trends in improvement in all the measured parameters but it was not statistically significant from the baseline. However, no further increment in the beneficial response was observed with the 3 gm/day dose. The three doses of Nigella sativa used in the study did not adversely affect either renal functions or hepatic functions of the diabetic patients throughout the study period.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of omalizumab treatment on changes in endothelin-1 (ET-1), which plays an important role in the development of airway inflammation and remodeling in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in patients with severe asthma. Methods: The study was conducted in a group of 19 patients with severe persistent allergic asthma treated with conventional therapy (according to the Global Initiative for Asthma, 2006) and with or without omalizumab (9 vs. 10 patients). Changes in ET-1 in EBC compared with other inflammatory parameters [exhaled nitric oxide \u2013 (FENO), blood eosinophil count, and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)] were measured after 16 and 52 weeks of therapy. Results: Omalizumab-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the concentrations of ET-1 in EBC, FENO, serum ECP, and blood eosinophil count and an increase in spirometry parameters compared to patients with conventional therapy. In the group of omalizumab-treated patients, statistically significant correlations between the decrease in ET-1 in EBC and a decrease in FENO, ECP, and blood eosinophil count as well as the increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 s after omalizumab therapy were revealed. Conclusions: Our results confirmed that anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab in patients with severe persistent allergic asthma results in decreased expression of ET-1 in the airways.

We observed the patients' general clinical information, surgical characteristics, postoperative vital signs, pathological findings, adjuvant therapies, and adverse effects. A urodynamic study was used to assess the bladder function. The patients' QOL was evaluated by Functional Assessment of Cervical Cancer Therapy (FACT-Cx). Results: Twenty-nine patients completed the study.

METHODS Patients referred for work-up of inconspicuous HGD/Ca were eligible and underwent both SVE and ETMI in randomized order within an interval of 6-12 weeks. During ETMI, inspection with HRE was followed by AFI. Detected lesions were inspected in detail with NBI and biopsied, followed by random biopsies. During SVE, any visible lesion was biopsied followed by random biopsies.   RESULTS Eighty-seven patients with BE underwent ETMI and SVE. No significant difference was observed in overall histologic yield between ETMI and SVE. ETMI had a significantly higher targeted yield compared with SVE because of AFI. However, the yield of targeted biopsies of ETMI was significantly inferior to the overall yield of SVE.

For both instruments, the internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha >70%) as was the convergent validity with each other but not with spirometry. The CCQ was responsive to improvements in respiratory symptoms at both week 26 (-1.02, SD = 0.81) and 52 (-1.04, SD = 0.91) and in the total score at week 26 (-0.54, SD = 0.50) and 52 (-0.43, SD = 0.44).

Each 14-day cycle consisted of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg), irinotecan (180 mg/m(2)), bolus FU (400 mg/m(2)), and leucovorin (400 mg/m(2)) followed by a 46-hour infusion of FU (2,400 mg/m(2)). Levels of 37 CAFs were assessed using multiplex-bead assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, during treatment, and at the time of progressive disease (PD).   RESULTS Forty-three patients were enrolled. Median progression-free survival (PFS), the primary end point of the study, was 12.8 months. Median overall survival was 31.3 months, with a response rate of 65%. Elevated interleukin-8 at baseline was associated with a shorter PFS (11 v 15.1 months, P = .03). Before the radiographic development of PD, several CAFs associated with angiogenesis and myeloid recruitment increased compared to baseline, including basic fibroblast growth factor (P = .046), hepatocyte growth factor (P = .046), placental growth factor (P < .001), stromal-derived factor-1 (P = .04), and macrophage chemoattractant protein-3 (P < .001).   CONCLUSION Efficacy and tolerability of FOLFIRI + B appeared favorable to historical controls in this single arm study.

Subjects and methods: The study was conducted in two parts, each comprising a 4-week baseline period, a 12-week, double-blind, parallel-group treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. The study had an adaptive design in that findings of Part 1 of the study were used to inform the conduct of Part 2. Following an interim analysis at the end of Part 1, the trial could be stopped for futility or continued in Part 2 to study the full-dose response or to increase sample size in case initial assumptions had been violated.

Body mass index (BMI), weight loss (WL) in the past 6 months and age were routinely recorded according to the French national recommendations for hospitalised patients; malnutrition was rated as absent, moderate or severe according to the level of WL and BMI. Age, sex, tumour site, type of hospitalisation and treatment, disease stage, World Health Organisation performance status (PS) and antibiotic therapy were the potential malnutrition risk factors tested.

Design: Prospective study with 10\u2009602 men, aged 50\u201359 years, recruited between 1991 and 1993 in three centres in France and one centre in Northern Ireland. Clinical and biological data were obtained at interview by trained staff. During the 10 years of follow-up 659 incident coronary events (CHD) were recorded. The relations between anthropometric markers and coronary events were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratios and BMI were positively associated with blood pressure (p<0.0001), diabetes (p<0.0001), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p<0.0001), triglycerides (p<0.0001) and inversely correlated to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p<0.0001).

Since an interferon (IFN) signature is variably expressed among RA patients, we investigated whether plasma type I IFN activity might predict the response to TNF antagonist therapy.   METHODS RA patients (n = 35), the majority of whom were Hispanic, from a single center were evaluated before and after initiation of TNF antagonist therapy. As controls, 12 RA patients from the same center who were not treated with a TNF antagonist were studied. Plasma type I IFN activity was measured using a reporter cell assay, and disease status was assessed using the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). Levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) were determined in baseline plasma samples using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The clinical response was classified according to the European League Against Rheumatism criteria for improvement in RA.   RESULTS Plasma type I IFN activity at baseline was significantly associated with clinical response (odds ratio 1.36 [95% confidence interval 1.05-1.76], P = 0.020), with high baseline IFN activity associated with a good response. Changes in DAS28 scores were greater among patients with a baseline plasma IFNbeta/alpha ratio >0.8 (indicating elevated plasma IFNbeta levels). Consistent with the capacity of IFNbeta to induce IL-1Ra, elevated baseline IL-1Ra levels were associated with better therapeutic outcomes (odds ratio 1.82 [95% confidence interval 1.1-3.29], P = 0.027).

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to compare the long-term efficacy of BCG and epirubicin.   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From January 1992 to February 1997, 957 patients with intermediate- or high-risk stage Ta T1 urothelial bladder cancer were randomized after transurethral resection to one of three treatment groups in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Genito-Urinary Group phase 3 trial 30911.   INTERVENTION Patients received six weekly instillations of epirubicin, BCG, or BCG plus isoniazid (INH) followed by three weekly maintenance instillations at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36.   MEASUREMENTS End points were time to recurrence, progression, distant metastases, overall survival, and disease-specific survival.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS With 837 eligible patients and a median follow-up of 9.2 yr, time to first recurrence (p<0.001), distant metastases (p=0.046), overall survival (p=0.023), and disease-specific survival (p=0.026) were significantly longer in the two BCG arms combined as compared with epirubicin; however, there was no difference for progression. Three hundred twenty-three patients with stage T1 or grade 3 tumors were high risk, and the remaining 497 patients were intermediate risk. The observed treatment benefit was at least as large, if not larger, in the intermediate-risk patients compared with the high-risk patients.   CONCLUSIONS In patients with intermediate- and high-risk stage Ta and T1 urothelial bladder cancer, intravesical BCG with or without INH is superior to intravesical epirubicin not only for time to first recurrence but also for time to distant metastases, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. The benefit of BCG is not limited to just high-risk patients; intermediate-risk patients also benefit from BCG.

Complete CM was evaluated in an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) population. Methods and results Two prospective clinical studies were conducted in 28 centres in Europe and Israel. Automatic CM data were compared with manual threshold measurements, the CM applicability was determined, and adjustments to pacing outputs were analysed. In total, 160 patients [age 64.6 \u00b1 10.4 years, 77% male, 80 ICD and 80 cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D)] were included. The differences between automatic and manual measurements were \u22640.25 V in 97% (RA CM) and 96% (RV CM) and were all within the safety margin. Fully automatic CM measurements were available within 1 week prior to the 3-month visit in 90% (RA), 99% (RV), and 97% (LV) of the patients. Results indicated increased output (threshold >2.5 V) due to raised RA threshold in seven (4.4%), high RV threshold in nine (5.6%), and high LV threshold in three patients (3.8%). All high threshold detections and all automatic modulations of pacing output were adjudicated appropriate.

Objective:Quadriceps weakness is a common clinical sign in persons with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis and results in physical disability; however, minimal data exist to establish whether quadriceps weakness is present in early stages of the disease. Therefore, our purpose was to determine whether quadriceps weakness was present in persons with early radiographic and cartilaginous evidence of osteoarthritis. Further, we sought to determine whether quadriceps strength decreases as osteoarthritis severity increases. Design:Three hundred forty-eight women completed radiologic and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, in addition to strength testing. Anterior-posterior radiographs were graded for tibiofemoral osteoarthritis severity using the Kellgren-Lawrence scale. Scans from magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess medial tibiofemoral and patellar cartilage based on a modification of the Noyes scale. The peak knee extension torque recorded was used to represent strength. Results:Quadriceps strength (Nm/kg) was 22% greater in women without radiographic osteoarthritis than in women with osteoarthritis (P < 0.05). Quadriceps strength was also greater in women with Noyes' medial tibial and femoral cartilage scores of 0 when compared in women with Noyes' grades 2 and 3\u20135 (P \u2264 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS After definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer 125 patients were randomized to 12 Gy radiotherapy before bicalutamide as prophylactic radiotherapy (53) or bicalutamide only for nonprophylactic radiotherapy (72). The incidence of gynecomastia, breast pain and tenderness, and discomfort perceived by the patients was assessed by physical examination and direct questioning at 3, 6 and 12 months of followup.   RESULTS At the end of 12 months the gynecomastia rate was 15.8% in the prophylactic group and 50.8% in the nonprophylactic group (p <0.001). On patient evaluation the breast enlargement rate was 34.4%. The severity of breast pain and tenderness was not different between the groups.

Recently, positive associations have been found between dietary acrylamide intakes, as estimated with a food frequency questionnaire using an acrylamide database, and cancer risk in some epidemiological studies. As acrylamide levels vary considerably within the same type of foods, a validation study was performed to investigate whether use of an acrylamide food database containing calculated mean acrylamide content, based on extensive sampling and chemical analysis of Dutch foods (several samples per food), can classify subjects with respect to true acrylamide intake.Subjects/Methods:We used the data from a 24-h duplicate diet study. The acrylamide content of 39 Dutch 24-h duplicate diets collected in 2004 was estimated using the mean acrylamide levels of foods available from the database and the menu list, on which the participants of the duplicate diet study had listed the amounts of individual foods and drinks in household units. Next, the acrylamide content of the total duplicate diets was analytically measured and correlated to the estimated acrylamide contents.Results:The Spearman's correlation coefficient between chemically determined acrylamide content and the calculated acrylamide content of the duplicate diets was 0.82 (P<0.001).Conclusions:This study indicates that it is possible to classify subjects with respect to acrylamide intake if mean instead of actual content of each food is applied.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin on the progression of AS. Methods and Results\u2014This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate AS and no clinical indications for cholesterol lowering. The patients were randomized to receive either placebo or rosuvastatin 40 mg daily. A total of 269 patients were randomized: 134 patients to rosuvastatin 40 mg daily and 135 patients to placebo. Annual echocardiograms were performed to assess AS progression, which was the primary outcome; the median follow-up was 3.5 years. The peak AS gradient increased in patients receiving rosuvastatin from a baseline of 40.8 11.1 to 57.8 22.7 mm Hg at the end of follow-up and in patients with placebo from 41.6 10.9 mm Hg at baseline to 54.8 19.8 mm Hg at the end of follow-up. The annualized increase in the peak AS gradient was 6.3 6.9 mm Hg in the rosuvastatin group and 6.1 8.2 mm Hg in the placebo group (P 0.83). Treatment with rosuvastatin was not associated with a reduction in AS progression in any of the predefined subgroups. Conclusion\u2014Cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin 40 mg did not reduce the progression of AS in patients with mild to moderate AS; thus, statins should not be used for the sole purpose of reducing the progression of AS.

We used a triple-crossover design and a composite of three outcomes (exacerbations, asthma-control days, and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second) to determine whether the frequency of a differential response to the step-up regimens was more than 25%.   RESULTS A differential response occurred in 161 of 165 patients who were evaluated (P<0.001).

Genetic variants in the AQP5 gene might be associated with rate of lung function decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AQP5 were genotyped in 429 European American individuals with COPD randomly selected from the NHLBI Lung Health Study. Mean annual decline in FEV1 % predicted, assessed over five years, was calculated as a linear regression slope, adjusting for potential covariates and stratified by smoking status. Constructs containing the wildtype allele and risk allele of the coding SNP N228K were generated using site-directed mutagenesis, and transfected into HBE-16 (human bronchial epithelial cell line). AQP5 abundance and localization were assessed by immunoblots and confocal immunofluoresence under control, shear stress and cigarette smoke extract (CSE 10%) exposed conditions to test for differential expression or localization. Results Among continuous smokers, three of the five SNPs tested showed significant associations (0.02>P>0.004) with rate of lung function decline; no associations were observed among the group of intermittent or former smokers. Haplotype tests revealed multiple association signals (0.012>P>0.0008) consistent with the single-SNP results. In HBE16 cells, shear stress and CSE led to a decrease in AQP5 abundance in the wild-type, but not in the N228K AQP5 plasmid.

Although serotoninergic dysfunction has been implicated in OCD, recent evidence suggests that dopamine may play a role as well.ObjectiveThe aim of the study was to evaluate learning and working memory in OCD and to determine the effects of dopaminergic manipulations on these capacities.MethodsVisuospatial associative memory and spatial and verbal working memory were examined in 18 nondepressed patients with OCD and 18 matched healthy controls. The study further investigated whether acute administration of dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist and antagonist would differentially modulate cognition in OCD. Each participant underwent the cognitive battery three times in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design.ResultsSignificant impairments in patients compared with controls were noted on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) paired associates learning (PAL) and a measure of sustained attention (rapid visual information processing, RVIP) that persisted across all sessions, with deficient strategy in the CANTAB spatial working memory task in the first session alone. Although the dopamine D2/D3 agonist, pramipexole, led to poorer performance on the PAL and RVIP tasks, no differential effects were noted between the two groups.

The Diabetes Utility Index\u00ea (DUI) was developed as a brief, self-administered, diabetes mellitusspecific PBMH that can efficiently estimate patient-derived health state utilities.  Objective: To describe the development of the valuation function for the DUI, and to report the validation results of the valuation function.  Methods: Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) was used as the framework to develop a valuation function for the DUI. Twenty of 768 possible health states of the DUI classified as anchor states, single-attribute level states including corner states, and marker states were selected and described for preference elicitation interviews. Visual analogue scale and standard gamble (SG) exercises were used to measure preferences from individuals with diabetes recruited from primary care and community settings in and around Morgantown, WV, USA for the 20 health states defined by combinations of DUI attributes and severity levels. Data collected in the interviews were used to develop a valuation function that calculates utilities for the DUI health states and calculates attribute-level utilities. A validation survey of the valuation function was conducted in collaboration with the West Virginia University (WVU) Diabetes Institute.  Results: A total of 100 individuals with diabetes were interviewed and their preferences for various DUI health states measured. From data generated in the interviews, a DUI valuation function was developed on a scale where 1.00 = perfect health (PH) and 0.00 = the all worse pits state, and adjusted to yield utilities on the conventional scale 1.00 =PH and 0.00 = dead.A total of 396 patients with diabetes who received care at WVU clinics completed a DUI mail validation survey (response rate = 33%). Clinical data consisting of International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, diagnosis codes and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values for the respondents were merged with their responses to the DUI. The utilities calculated by the scoring function of the DUI compared favourably to cardinal SG utilities for three DUI health states for which both assessments were available. The DUI utility function slightly underestimated actual SG utilities for mild and moderate health states (mean absolute difference = 0.05).There was a small but significant correlation between DUI utility scores and average past year HbA1c values (r=-0.30; p < 0.001). Respondents with two or more complications had significantly lower DUI utilities than those with no complications (p < 0.001) or one complication (p = 0.015). Insulin users had significantly lower DUI utilities than non-users (p < 0.001), and those with HbA1c values <7% had significantly higher DUI utilities than those with HbA1c values of 7% (p < 0.001).

METHODS The study group consisted of 108 patients with rectal cancer. Patients with low rectal cancer had low anterior resection with stapled straight low colorectal or coloanal anastomosis without proximal diversion. They were prospectively randomized to either oxidized regenerated cellulose reinforcement or no reinforcement. Data collected included age, sex, hemoglobin percentage, albumin level, histopathologic type of the tumor, anastomotic leak, and stricture.   RESULTS The mean age of patients was 56 years, and sex was matched in both groups. Clinical leak occurred in 6 of 38 cases (15.7%) in the group that did not undergo reinforcement versus 2 of 33 (6.1%) in the oxidized regenerated cellulose reinforcement group (P < .01). In the case of a leak, diversion was needed in 3 of 6 patients in the group that did not undergo reinforcement vs no patients in the oxidized regenerated cellulose reinforcement group (P = .05).

A low grade of SOC was found in eight of the patients in the treatment group and in 17 of the control group at baseline, with a statistically significant difference between the groups. Logistic regression analyses revealed that, after correcting for the background variables, the resilient appliance did not differ from the non-occluding control appliance in terms of treatment outcome. No statistically significant differences were found when correlating mean SOC with grade of depression, grade of non-specific physical symptoms and general health. Conclusions. These findings indicate that none of the studied background variables (age, gender, SOC, depression, non-specific physical symptoms or general health) seemed to influence the short-term efficacy of intraoral appliances.

Nine patients of the 53 received radiotherapy for primary tumors. Clinical features and prognosis was determined, and various factors were analyzed as to their usefulness as prognostic factors (age, gender, location, size, depth, surgical margin, and adjuvant radiotherapy). The minimum followup was 12\u00a0months (mean, 60\u00a0months; range, 12\u2013226\u00a0months).ResultsSeven (13%) and 6 (11%) patients developed a local recurrence and distant metastasis, respectively.

BACKGROUND First-generation drug-eluting stents have reduced angiographic and clinical restenosis, but long-term safety remains controversial. A second-generation drug-eluting stent, which delivers zotarolimus, a potent antiproliferative agent, via a biocompatible phosphorylcholine polymer on a cobalt alloy thin-strut stent has shown promising experimental and early clinical results.   METHODS This is a prospective, randomized (1:1), single-blind, controlled trial comparing outcomes of patients with single de novo coronary lesions treated with ZES or PES. The primary end point was noninferiority of 9-month target vessel failure defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.   RESULTS Among a total of 1,548 patients assigned to ZES (n = 773) or PES (n = 775), at 9 months, ZES was noninferior to PES with rates of target vessel failure 6.6% versus 7.1%, respectively (p(noninferiority) < or = 0.001). There were fewer periprocedural myocardial infarctions with ZES (0.5% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.007), whereas at 12 months, there were no significant differences between groups in rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stent thrombosis. Although incidence of 8-month binary angiographic in-segment restenosis was higher in patients treated with ZES versus PES (15.3% vs. 10.4%; p = 0.284), rates of 12-month target lesion revascularization were similar (4.5% vs. 3.2%; p = 0.228), especially in patients without planned angiographic follow-up (3.6% vs. 3.2%; p = 0.756).

METHODS Sun Protection of Florida's Children was a cluster randomized trial promoting hat use at (primary outcome) and outside of schools among fourth-grade students during August 8, 2006, through May 22, 2007. Twenty-two schools were randomly assigned to the intervention (1115 students) or control group (1376 students). Intervention schools received classroom sessions targeting sun protection attitudes and social norms. Each student attending an intervention school received two free wide-brimmed hats. Hat use at school was measured by direct observation and hat use outside of school was measured by self-report. A subgroup of 378 students (178 in the intervention group and 200 in the control group) underwent serial measurements of skin pigmentation to explore potential physiological effects of the intervention. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the intervention effect by accounting for the cluster randomized trial design.

Experimental Design: Telatinib twice daily continuously, irinotecan once every 3 weeks, and capecitabine oral twice daily on day 1 to 14 were administered in cycles of 21 days in escalating doses in successive cohorts. Toxicity was evaluated to conform to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Pharmacokinetic and (circulating) endothelial (progenitor) cell measurements were done. Tumor efficacy was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Results: Twenty-three patients were included in this phase I trial. Most frequently (>25%) reported adverse events of any grade were vomiting, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, alopecia, and hand-foot syndrome. A silent myocardial infarction and two cases of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction were reported; both were reversible. Cardiac monitoring of the subsequent patients did not reveal other abnormalities.

To assess the responsiveness and minimal clinically important change (MCIC) of 6 commonly-used performance tests (5-minute walking, 50-ft walking, sit-to-stand, 1 minute stair climbing, loaded forward reach, Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation). Summary of Background Data. Performance tests are used to evaluate physical function in people with low back pain. Little is known about their clinimetric properties. Methods. Performance tests were administered in people with chronic nonspecific low back pain (n = 198) before and after 10 weeks of treatment. At 10 weeks, the global perceived effect scale was used to determine if participants judged themselves as worsened, unchanged, or improved. The mean change scores for each performance test were calculated. A performance test was considered responsive if the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was equal to or greater than 0.70. We used 2 methods to evaluate MCIC: the optimal cut-off point based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, which takes into account both sensitivity and specificity, and the minimal detectable change for improvement, which considers test specificity only. Results. In general, the mean change scores were the smallest in participants who judged themselves worsened and largest in those reporting to be improved. Sit-to-stand (AUC = 0.75) and stair climbing (AUC = 0.72) were the only performance tests that showed adequate responsiveness. For sit-to-stand, the MCIC ranged from 4.1 to 9.8 seconds (19%\u201345% of the mean baseline score).

Methods: Twenty chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 consecutive sessions of either 1) bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (anodal tDCS to upregulate excitability of ipsilesional motor cortex and cathodal tDCS to downregulate excitability of contralesional motor cortex) with simultaneous physical/occupational therapy or 2) sham stimulation with simultaneous physical/occupational therapy. Changes in motor impairment (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer) and motor activity (Wolf Motor Function Test) assessments were outcome measures while functional imaging parameters were used to identify neural correlates of motor improvement. Results: The improvement of motor function was significantly greater in the real stimulation group (20.7% in Fugl-Meyer and 19.1% in Wolf Motor Function Test scores) when compared to the sham group (3.2% in Fugl-Meyer and 6.0% in Wolf Motor Function Test scores).

Conclusions: The combination of bihemispheric tDCS and peripheral sensorimotor activities improved motor functions in chronic stroke patients that outlasted the intervention period. This novel approach may potentiate cerebral adaptive processes that facilitate motor recovery after stroke. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that for adult patients with ischemic stroke treated at least 5 months after their first and only stroke, bihemispheric tDCS and simultaneous physical/occupational therapy given over 5 consecutive sessions significantly improves motor function as measured by the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer assessment (raw change treated 6.1 \u00b1 3.4, sham 1.2 \u00b1 1.0).", "1_year_count": 27, "label": 1}, {"paper_id": "430e607f6cf746b648f29c86b45b4aa550e9dfe3", "text": "Samarium\u2010153 ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphoric acid (153Sm\u2010EDTMP) is a radiopharmaceutical that has been used to treat osteosarcoma.

The specific role of A-type and persistent K-currents in shaping neuronal excitability remains partially unexplained by electrophysiological data. Drosophila motor neurons provide a model system to study the differential contributions of voltage-dependent K-currents to the dynamics of the membrane potential. In this work, the theoretical plausibility of existing hypotheses about the differential involvement of A-type currents in delaying spiking activity is examined through a mathematical model constructed using known macroscopic biophysical properties of voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating and fast inactivating A-type Drosophila channels. The model is constrained first by electrophysiological data, and an analysis of the membrane dynamics is performed through systematic variation of the ratios of the maximal whole-membrane currents. Different ratios among the numbers of the different channels in the model capture the basic features of responses to square pulse stimulation previously observed in Drosophila motor neurons for embryo, larvae and adult motor neurons, Kenyon cells, and giant cultured cells. The model supports the notion that slowly inactivating potassium currents are necessary for sustained spiking activity. The model also supports the hypothesis that early inactivating A-type K+ (Shal) channels are responsible for experimentally observed delays in the onset of spiking. In contrast, Shaker A-type channels with more depolarized steady state inactivation also contribute to the delay to first spike, but less than Shal. Instead, Shaker channels gate single and repetitive spiking. Furthermore, the model elucidates a biophysical mechanism that allows neurons to diversify their function, in this case by combining additive and resonant properties.

Because psychiatric disorders significantly influence the development and severity of oral lichen planus, the use of psychiatric drug therapy may be an adjunct in treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of drug therapy of psychiatric disorders in oral lichen planus.   STUDY DESIGN Our controlled clinical study consisted of forty-six patients with oral lichen planus and psychiatric disorders who were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups were given topical corticosteroids and the study group received additional psychiatric drug therapy. Patients were monitored for a period of 6 months. Response to treatment was evaluated in each group and was compared with the other group using Mann-Whitney tests. We evaluated the correlation between psychiatric disorders and the recovery of oral lesions using Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis.   RESULTS Decrease in the size of the lesions was significantly greater in the study group after six months, but this difference was not significant in relationship to the pain experienced and the kind of lesion. Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that, in the sixth month, there was a significant and direct relationship between recovery from the psychiatric disorders and response to treatment of OLP lesions, particularly as it pertained to the kind of lesion.

We aimed to assess the components of socioeconomic risk both independently and through their influence on the known behavioural risk factors of smoking, alcohol consumption and diet.   PATIENTS AND METHODS A multicentre case-control study with 2198 cases of UADT cancer and 2141 controls from hospital and population sources was undertaken involving 14 centres from 10 countries. Personal interviews collected information on demographics, lifetime occupation history, smoking, alcohol consumption and diet. Socioeconomic status was measured by education, occupational social class and unemployment. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using unconditional logistic regression.   RESULTS When controlling for age, sex and centre significantly increased risks for UADT cancer were observed for those with low versus high educational attainment OR=1.98 (95% CI 1.67, 2.36). Similarly, for occupational socioeconomic indicators--comparing the lowest versus highest International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI) quartile for the longest occupation gave OR=1.60 (1.28, 2.00); and for unemployment OR=1.64 (1.24, 2.17).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study using a face to face structured interview schedule was conducted amongst purposively sampled UK-resident adult Yemeni male khat chewers, aged 18 years and above, selected during random visits to places of khat sale. A factor analysis with principal components extraction was conducted to explore the construct validity of the proposed SDS-khat. Reliability of the proposed scale was assessed using test-retest and internal reliability tests. The concurrent validity of the proposed SDS-khat was assessed in relation to individual measures and a composite index of khat chewing behaviours using univariate analyses.   RESULTS Two hundred and four Yemeni male adult khat chewers were interviewed. The mean score of the proposed SDS-khat was 5.52 (SD \u00b14.03). Forty nine percent of respondents (95% CI=43-55%) with \u22645 scores were more likely not psychologically dependent. A single factor, uni-dimensional solution identifying the five items making up the scale accounted for 52.33% of variance. The internal reliability was good (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.76) and the test retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.93 (95% CI=0.80-0.97). Many individual aspects of the khat chewing were significantly related to the scale. Assessment of the proposed SDS-khat's concurrent validity with individual items of khat chewing identified several significant relationships (p\u22640.05) whilst the composite index of khat behaviour also identified a significant relationship (OR=14.40, 95% CI=6.71-30.89).

The WISDM-68 subscales have demonstrated good psychometric characteristics and have the potential to elucidate diverse nicotine dependence factors and mechanisms. The present research aimed to shorten the WISDM to reduce assessment burden while maintaining or enhancing its psychometric properties.   METHODS Data from three independent samples (one longitudinal observational study and two randomized clinical trials) were used to select subscales and reduced sets of items in order to develop and test a brief version of the WISDM-68. The full-item and reduced-item versions of the WISDM were then compared in terms of reliability, validity, and model fit (via confirmatory factor analysis) in the three independent samples.   RESULTS Thirty-one items were dropped from the WISDM, the Behavioral Choice-Melioration subscale was dropped, and the Negative and Positive Reinforcement subscales were consolidated. This resulted in a new WISDM short form (Brief WISDM) comprising 37 items that load onto 11 subscales. The psychometric properties of the reduced-item WISDM subscales were found to be comparable with the full-item subscales in terms of internal consistency, long-term stability, concurrent validity, predictive validity, and model fit.

Although the requisite therapy, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been implicated in the progression of Barrett's oesophagus in animal models, harmful effects of prolonged PPI therapy in Barrett's oesophagus is both inconclusive and controversial. We therefore aimed to test the role of PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia in vitro and see whether any biological parameters were useful surrogates of long-term therapy in man. Methods We undertook detailed serological and tissue assessment of gastrin and CCK2 receptors in 90 patients randomised to different doses of PPI therapy during a detailed 2-year follow-up. We also undertook a comprehensive study of cell models to study the consequential biological effects of gastrin on the mucosa. Results Gastrin and its cognate receptor CCK2R were expressed highest in the stomach, then less in Barrett's oesophagus and least in squamous oesophagus (SqE) (n=20 paired t-test, p<0.01). Analysis of the change in Barrett's oesophagus segment length change in 70 patients who were randomised to high or low PPI dose showed no difference over 2\u2005years (n=70 t-test, p=0.8). Prolonged PPI use did, however, increase the serum gastrin, (36\u2005pg/ml\u00b157\u2005pg/ml to 103\u2005pg/ml\u00b194\u2005pg/ml (paired t test, p<0.05)).

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of OXT on fear-related amygdala reactivity in GSAD and matched healthy control (CON) subjects. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful, angry, and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of OXT (24\u2009IU or 40.32\u2009\u03bcg) and placebo in 18 GSAD and 18 CON subjects.

OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the CON group, but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the GSAD group, such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT (ie, normalization). These findings suggest that OXT has a specific effect on fear-related amygdala activity, particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive, such as in GSAD, thereby providing a brain-based mechanism of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety.", "1_year_count": 26, "label": 1}, {"paper_id": "7379dab2c57b012cca3a3accc4fb0689dfe84d3d", "text": "Background and aims Although critical for methylation reactions, how dietary folate and B vitamins affect global DNA methylation level in colorectal cancers is currently unknown.

METHODS This is a randomized, observer-blinded, single-center trial conducted across a time span of 13 months. A total of 299 patients were allocated to either a restricted intravenous fluid regimen with supplementary intravenous fluids given based on serum lactate level (group A) or a standard restricted regimen (group R). In group A, the serum lactate level was monitored closely postoperatively to maintain a normal pre-operative serum lactate level. Group R involved patients treated with a restricted fluid regimen in whom additional fluid and electrolytes were administered when deemed necessary based on the usual clinical criteria. The primary outcome measure was complications; the secondary measures were death and adverse effects.   RESULTS Additional fluid supplementation was needed in some patients in both groups (group A [28%] vs group R [26%]). In group A, the time for additional fluid infusion occurred earlier in the postoperative period than group R. Patients in group A received their first supplementary fluid treatment within the first 12 h more commonly than those in group R (74% vs 37%, respectively; P < .004). The regimen adjusted by serum lactate decreased systemic postoperative complications in group A versus group R (10% vs 22%, respectively; P = .023) but not overall total complications (23% vs 33%, respectively; P = .090).

The Lysholm score in the active treatment group was 53.4\u00a0at the beginning, 90 after 1\u00a0week, 94.5 after the third week and 91 by the fifth week (significant difference). There were no side effects.ConclusionTENS therapy with HAN stimulation resulted in pain relief in patients with gonarthrosis during the therapy period with TENS, but the pain relief did not last beyond the end of the TENS therapy. There was an improvement in the Lysholm score and the WOMAC score during the therapy. This improvement remained over the following 2-week period of observation without further TENS therapy.

Serum TG levels are an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and are strongly determined by very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) composition, which can be specifically modified by dietary lipid source. Within the context of the PREDIMED study, we assessed the VLDL composition in 50 participants after 3 months of intake of two MD, supplemented with VOO or nuts, compared with a low-fat diet. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were reduced in subjects on the MD+nuts, whereas HDL-cholesterol increased after consumption of the MD+VOO.

However, only the MD+VOO reduced the VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-TG content and the TG/apolipoprotein B ratio in VLDL, which was used to estimate particle size. Although VLDL-TG fatty acids were very slightly modified, VLDL-TG molecular species in VLDL after consumption of the MD+nuts were characterized by a higher presence of linoleic acid (18:2, n-6), whereas after the intake of MD+VOO, they were rich in oleic acid (18:1, n-9).

We investigated the prevalence and correlates of dependence among older people from middle income countries.MethodsA one-phase cross-sectional survey was carried out at 11 sites in seven countries (urban sites in Cuba, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic, urban and rural sites in Peru, Mexico, China and India). All those aged 65 years and over living in geographically defined catchment areas were eligible. In all, 15,022 interviews were completed with an informant interview for each participant. The full 10/66 Dementia Research Group survey protocol was applied, including ascertainment of depression, dementia, physical impairments and self-reported diagnoses. Dependence was interviewer-rated based on a key informant's responses to a set of open-ended questions on the participant's needs for care. We estimated the prevalence of dependence and the independent contribution of underlying health conditions. Site-specific prevalence ratios were meta-analysed, and population attributable prevalence fractions (PAPF) calculated.ResultsThe prevalence of dependence increased with age at all sites, with a tendency for the prevalence to be lower in men than in women. Age-standardised prevalence was lower in all sites than in the USA. Other than in rural China, dementia made the largest independent contribution to dependence, with a median PAPF of 34% (range 23%-59%).

METHODS A retrospective study of patients admitted with pulmonary embolism confirmed by CT pulmonary angiogram to three teaching hospitals in East Scotland between January 2005 and July 2007. Two radiologists judged presence of right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram independently. The outcome of interest was 30 day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare this outcome in patients with right ventricular dilation compared to those without right ventricular dilation, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score.   RESULTS There were 585 patients included and 30.4% had right ventricular dilation on CT pulmonary angiogram. Patients with right ventricular dilation had increased 30 day mortality rates compared to patients without right ventricular dilation (12.4% vs. 5.4%; p=0.006). Survival analysis showed that a significantly greater proportion of deaths in the right ventricular dilation group occurred within the first 48h after admission compared to the group without right ventricular dilation (45.5% deaths vs. 9.1%; p=0.016). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score, right ventricular dilation was independently associated with increased 30 day mortality (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.54-5.75; p=0.001).

Forty ASA I-II patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were randomized into two groups: Group R (n=20) and Group V (n=20). In Group R, 5 mg bupivacaine was administered into the spinal space. Anesthesia induction in Group V was established with sevoflurane + 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium using the maximum vital capacity technique. Anesthesia was maintained with 2-3% sevoflurane + 50% N2O/O2 inhalation. All patients were tested with a 24-hour Holter ECG device. QT, QTc, and QTd intervals were measured using 12-lead ECG records at 1 and 3 minutes during preinduction, postinduction, postincision and postextubation periods.

Discontinuation of the initiated treatment was used as criterion for effectiveness and patients' drug attitude was shown to be predictive for non-adherence or discontinuation of long-term treatment in schizophrenia. Accordingly, the predictive validity of the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) for effectiveness should be evaluated. Based on a sub-sample of patients from the EUFEST study for whom DAI assessments were available significant predictors for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of initiated treatment were identified based on a logistic and a Cox-regression analysis. A Receiver-Operating Characteristic- (ROC-) analysis was conducted for the DAI, prognostic / diagnostic parameters (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated and a cut-off value suggested. In a sample of 228 first-episode patients, the DAI score was the most powerful predictor for effectiveness (p<0.001) besides two other significant predictors (PANSS-positive score and sexual side effects). The ROC-analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.64 (p<0.001). The suggested cut-off point of about 20 yielded a sensitivity of 70-75% and a specificity of 40-45%. Study results indicate that the Drug Attitude Inventory, filled in by patients early in treatment seems to be a valid predictor for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of the initiated treatment.

METHODS This prospective clinical study was a pilot involving 63 female patients. Before surgery, patients with tumors overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 received four cycles of 60 mg/m(2) anthracycline and 600 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks, whereas those whose tumors did not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 received four cycles of 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 600 mg/m(2) cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks. A quasi-pathological complete response (i.e. absence of invasive tumor or only focal residual tumor cells) was the primary endpoint, with compliance and predictors for each regimen as secondary endpoints. If a quasi-pathological complete response was not achieved, then crossover to the alternative treatment was recommended.   RESULTS The quasi-pathological complete response rate was 36.5% (23 of 63) overall, 27.8% (5 of 18) for the anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimen and 40.0% (18 of 45) for the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide regimen. Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide treatment induced a quasi-pathological complete response in most patients with triple-negative tumors (15 of 19). The relative dose intensity was 97.3% for the anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimen and 96.6% for the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide regimen.

Interventions High flow oxygen treatment compared with titrated oxygen treatment in the prehospital (ambulance/paramedic) setting. Main outcome measure Prehospital or in-hospital mortality. Results In an intention to treat analysis, the risk of death was significantly lower in the titrated oxygen arm compared with the high flow oxygen arm for all patients (high flow oxygen n=226; titrated oxygen n=179) and for the subgroup of patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (high flow n=117; titrated n=97). Overall mortality was 9% (21 deaths) in the high flow oxygen arm compared with 4% (7 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm; mortality in the subgroup with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 9% (11 deaths) in the high flow arm compared with 2% (2 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm. Titrated oxygen treatment reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen by 58% for all patients (relative risk 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.89; P=0.02) and by 78% for the patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.22, 0.05 to 0.91; P=0.04). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received titrated oxygen according to the protocol were significantly less likely to have respiratory acidosis (mean difference in pH 0.12 (SE 0.05); P=0.01; n=28) or hypercapnia (mean difference in arterial carbon dioxide pressure \u221233.6 (16.3) mm Hg; P=0.02; n=29) than were patients who received high flow oxygen.

Included were 3,278 participants (2,013 women and 541 African Americans), aged 65 or older at enrollment, who had at least five weight measurements. Weight was measured at annual clinic visits between 1992 and 1999, and summary measures of mean weight, coefficient of variation, average annual weight change, and episodes of loss and gain (cycling) were calculated. Participants were followed from 1999 to 2006 for activities of daily living (ADL) difficulty, incident mobility limitations, and mortality.   RESULTS Higher mean weight, weight variability, and weight cycling increased the risk of new onset of ADL difficulties and mobility limitations. After adjustment for risk factors, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for weight cycling for incident ADL impairment was 1.28 (1.12, 1.47), similar to that for several comorbidities in our model, including cancer and diabetes. Lower weight, weight loss, higher variability, and weight cycling were all risk factors for mortality, after adjustment for demographic risk factors, height, self-report health status, and comorbidities.

A maximum tolerated dose and initial signal of efficacy in BRCA-deficient ovarian cancers have been reported. We therefore assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib alone in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and advanced breast cancer.   METHODS Women (aged >or=18 years) with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and recurrent, advanced breast cancer were assigned to two sequential cohorts in a phase 2 study undertaken in 16 centres in Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA. The first cohort (n=27) was given continuous oral olaparib at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg twice daily), and the second (n=27) was given a lower dose (100 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00494234.   FINDINGS Patients had been given a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range 1-5 in cohort 1, and 2-4 in cohort 2). ORR was 11 (41%) of 27 patients (95% CI 25-59) in the cohort assigned to 400 mg twice daily, and six (22%) of 27 (11-41) in the cohort assigned to 100 mg twice daily. Toxicities were mainly at low grades. The most frequent causally related adverse events in the cohort given 400 mg twice daily were fatigue (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), nausea (grade 1 or 2, 11 [41%]; grade 3 or 4, four [15%]), vomiting (grade 1 or 2, three [11%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]), and anaemia (grade 1 or 2, one [4%]; grade 3 or 4, three [11%]).

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial.   ANIMALS 70 dogs with no clinically important abnormalities other than osteoarthritis for which they were not currently being treated.   PROCEDURES Dogs wore an AM continuously for 21 days. On days 8 through 21, the dogs were treated with carprofen (n = 35) or a placebo (35). Total activity counts for days 1 through 7 (baseline) were compared with total activity counts for days 15 through 21 (endpoint). The change in total activity count from baseline to endpoint was assessed within each treatment group as well as between groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to test for an association between treatment and percentage change in activity counts while controlling for other variables.   RESULTS For placebo-treated dogs, median baseline total activity count was not significantly different from median endpoint total activity count (1,378,408 vs 1,310,112, respectively). For dogs receiving carprofen, there was a significant increase in median activity count from baseline to endpoint (1,276,427 vs 1,374,133).

Results were evaluated by use of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) self-administered questionnaire; Rowe score; Constant score normalized for age and gender, and recurrence of dislocation.ResultsOn analyzing the results at a 2-year follow-up, we considered the following independent variables: age; gender; arm dominance; duration of symptoms, age at first dislocation, number of dislocations, type of work; type of sport; sports activity level; lesion of the anterior labrum and anterior-inferior gleno-humeral ligament; SLAP lesion, and number of suture anchors.

We would like to contribute the results of a similar study that we performed on MS-discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, a setting that further decreases the possibility of heritable and non-heritable confounders. In 20 pairs of MS-discordant monozygotic twins, selected as described previously, we evaluated the humoral responses to the viruses investigated by Comabella et al. (EBV, human herpesvirus-6 [HHV6], human cytomegalovirus [CMV], measles virus [MV]) plus four additional pathogens: varicella zoster (VZV), herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1), HSV-2 and Bordetella pertussis (Bp). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all participating subjects gave written informed consent. The following commercially available kits were used: Captia EBNA-1 IgG, VCA (P-18) IgG and Captia EA-D IgG for EBV, IgG EIA Panbio for HHV-6, IgG EIA Serion Gmbh for CMV, IgG EIA Serion Gmbh for MV, IgG EIA Serion Gmbh for VZV, IgG EIA Serion Gmbh for HSV 1-2 and IgG EIA Serion Gmbh for Bp. The results were interpreted according to the manufacturers\u2019 criteria. The mean age in this series was 36.5 8.3 years. None of the affected individuals had ever taken diseasemodifying therapies. All of the samples were obtained at least 3 months after the last steroid therapy. Overall, in disease discordant MZ twins the humoral responses to the above pathogens did not correlate with the MS status (Mann\u2013Whitney U-test). Surprisingly, however, in 7 out of 20 pairs, the healthy twins were EBV-seronegative according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines and to generally accepted criteria. At a different time point, 1 year apart from the first, EBV serology was repeated on three of the seven MZ pairs that had a seronegative healthy individual and on three pairs where both co-twins were seropositive. In all subjects the result did not vary substantially compared with the first time point. To further verify the reliability of the results (EBV is a ubiquitous infection and therefore a discordant serological EBV status in MZ co-twins is unexpected) a different laboratory reassayed aliquots of the same sera of 9 of the 20 twin pairs, including 4 of the pairs with a seronegative healthy twin, using a different antiviral assay as described previously (anti-EBV VCA and EBNA-1 IgG and IgM, Wampole Laboratories). This time the EBV-seronegative status of the healthy individuals was not confirmed. Commercially available EBV enzyme immunoassays can differ considerably in performance. This may explain the discrepancies in our results and those between previous studies on twins, thus stressing the importance of validating the data with different assays. Variable results may also be expected on the basis of possible components of heterogeneity at the population level in the cause of MS. For these reasons, and given the positive results of Comabella et al., the association between MS status and EBV serology that emerged in some of the tests that we have performed should not be overlooked, also considering the lack of substantial genetic, epigenetic and transcriptome variations in identical twins discordant for MS.", "1_year_count": 1, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "cf2f2b7e814b51cc19bcef6c772895cebd752f89", "text": "Four different sources for cascade effects were examined using 9-year process and outcome data from a randomized controlled trial of a preventive intervention using the Parent Management Training-Oregon Model (PMTO\u2122).

DESIGN Randomised trial of equivalency.   SETTING Pulmonary rehabilitation service of a primary care trust delivered at two physiotherapy outpatient departments.   PARTICIPANTS Thirty patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test (ISWT), Endurance Shuttle Walking Test (ESWT) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), assessed at baseline and at completion of the supervised programme. Secondary outcomes were home-exercise activity, attendance levels and patient satisfaction with the programme.   INTERVENTIONS The once-weekly group (n=15) received one supervised rehabilitation session per week, and the twice-weekly group (n=15) received two sessions per week, both for 8 weeks, together with a home-exercise plan.   RESULTS After pulmonary rehabilitation, the groups showed similar improvements in exercise tolerance (median values: ISWT once-weekly 60metres, twice-weekly 50metres; ESWT once-weekly 226seconds, twice-weekly 109seconds). However, for health-related quality-of-life, the once-weekly group's score did not change (SGRQ 0), whereas an improvement was seen for the twice-weekly group (SGRQ 3.7). The number of home-exercise sessions and attendance levels were similar between the groups. Patient satisfaction with both formats was high and almost identical between the groups.   CONCLUSIONS This pilot provides data to inform a larger study and shows that the methodology is feasible.

BACKGROUND Dietary flavanols can improve endothelial dysfunction. The CACs, also termed endothelial progenitor cells, are critical for vascular repair and maintenance of endothelial function.   METHODS In a randomized, controlled, double-masked, cross-over trial, 16 CAD patients (64+/-3 years of age) received a dietary high-flavanol intervention (HiFI [375 mg]) and a macronutrient- and micronutrient-matched low-flavanol intervention (LoFI [9 mg]) twice daily in random order over 30 days.   RESULTS Endothelium-dependent vasomotor function, as measured by flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery, improved by 47% in the HiFI period compared with the LoFI period. After HiFI, the number of CD34+/KDR+-CACs, as measured by flow cytometry, increased 2.2-fold as compared with after LoFI. The CAC functions, as measured by the capacity to survive, differentiate, proliferate, and to migrate were not different between the groups. The HiFI led to a decrease in systolic blood pressure (mean change over LoFI: -4.2+/-2.7 mm Hg), and increase in plasma nitrite level (mean change over LoFI: 74+/-32 nM). Applying a mixed-effects linear regression model, the results demonstrated a significant increase in flow-mediated vasodilation and a decrease in systolic blood pressure with increasing levels of CD34+/KDR+-CACs.   CONCLUSIONS Sustained improvements in endothelial dysfunction by regular dietary intake of flavanols are associated with mobilization of functional CACs.

Hyperoxia can be delivered to the brain under normobaric as well as hyperbaric conditions. In this study the authors directly compare hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) and normobaric hyperoxia (NBH) treatment effects.   METHODS Sixty-nine patients who had sustained severe TBIs (mean Glasgow Coma Scale Score 5.8) were prospectively randomized to 1 of 3 groups within 24 hours of injury: 1) HBO2, 60 minutes of HBO(2) at 1.5 ATA; 2) NBH, 3 hours of 100% fraction of inspired oxygen at 1 ATA; and 3) control, standard care. Treatments occurred once every 24 hours for 3 consecutive days. Brain tissue PO(2), microdialysis, and intracranial pressure were continuously monitored. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), arteriovenous differences in oxygen, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), CSF lactate and F2-isoprostane concentrations, and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 assays were obtained pretreatment and 1 and 6 hours posttreatment. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to statistically test differences among the treatment arms as well as changes from pretreatment to posttreatment.   RESULTS In comparison with values in the control group, the brain tissue PO2 levels were significantly increased during treatment in both the HBO2 (mean +/- SEM, 223 +/- 29 mm Hg) and NBH (86 +/- 12 mm Hg) groups (p < 0.0001) and following HBO2 until the next treatment session (p = 0.003). Hyperbaric O2 significantly increased CBF and CMRO2 for 6 hours (p < or = 0.01). Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentrations decreased posttreatment in both the HBO2 and NBH groups (p < 0.05). The dialysate lactate levels in patients who had received HBO2 decreased for 5 hours posttreatment (p = 0.017). Microdialysis lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratios were significantly decreased posttreatment in both HBO2 and NBH groups (p < 0.05). Cerebral blood flow, CMRO2, microdialysate lactate, and the L/P ratio had significantly greater improvement when a brain tissue PO2 > or = 200 mm Hg was achieved during treatment (p < 0.01). Intracranial pressure was significantly lower after HBO2 until the next treatment session (p < 0.001) in comparison with levels in the control group. The treatment effect persisted over all 3 days. No increase was seen in the CSF F2-isoprostane levels, microdialysate glycerol, and BAL inflammatory markers, which were used to monitor potential O2 toxicity.   CONCLUSIONS Hyperbaric O2 has a more robust posttreatment effect than NBH on oxidative cerebral metabolism related to its ability to produce a brain tissue PO2 > or = 200 mm Hg.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty-two adult patients were treated. Intravenous ridaforolimus was given once weekly for 3 weeks and capecitabine was given from days 1 to 14 every 4 weeks. Ridaforolimus was given at 25, 37.5, 50, or 75 mg with capecitabine at 1,650 mg/m(2) or 1,800 mg/m(2) divided into two daily doses. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were determined during cycles 1 and 2. Pharmacodynamic studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and wound tissue of the skin characterized pathways associated with the metabolism or disposition of fluoropyrimidines and mTOR and ERK signaling.   RESULTS Two recommended doses (RDs) were defined: 75 mg ridaforolimus/1,650 mg/m(2) capecitabine and 50 mg ridaforolimus/1,800 mg/m(2) capecitabine. Dose-limiting toxicities were stomatitis and skin rash. One patient achieved a partial response lasting 10 months and 10 of 29 evaluable patients had stable disease for \u2265 6 months. The only pharmacokinetic interaction was a ridaforolimus-induced increase in plasma exposure to fluorouracil. PBMC data suggested that prolonged exposure to capecitabine reduced the ridaforolimus inhibition of mTOR. Ridaforolimus influenced the metabolism of fluoropyrimidines and inhibited dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, behavior similar to that of rapamycin. Inhibition of the target thymidylate synthase by capecitabine was unaffected. mTOR and ERK signaling was inhibited in proliferating endothelial cells and was more pronounced at the RD with the larger amount of ridaforolimus.

Counseling was delivered by a bilingual Latina health educator, and the content was tailored to Latino values and culture. It was not necessary for smokers to want to quit smoking to participate. Smoking cessation was biochemically verified and secondhand smoke exposure was objectively measured through passive nicotine monitors.

However, little is known about the role of individual variations in these responses. The present study investigated the effect of trait anxiety on the neural responses mediating the impact of transient anxiety-inducing task-irrelevant distraction on cognitive performance, and on the neural correlates of coping with such distraction. We investigated whether activity in the brain regions sensitive to emotional distraction would show dissociable patterns of co-variation with measures indexing individual variations in trait anxiety and cognitive performance. Methodology/Principal Findings Event-related fMRI data, recorded while healthy female participants performed a delayed-response working memory (WM) task with distraction, were investigated in conjunction with behavioural measures that assessed individual variations in both trait anxiety and WM performance. Consistent with increased sensitivity to emotional cues in high anxiety, specific perceptual areas (fusiform gyrus - FG) exhibited increased activity that was positively correlated with trait anxiety and negatively correlated with WM performance, whereas specific executive regions (right lateral prefrontal cortex - PFC) exhibited decreased activity that was negatively correlated with trait anxiety. The study also identified a role of the medial and left lateral PFC in coping with distraction, as opposed to reflecting a detrimental impact of emotional distraction. Conclusions These findings provide initial evidence concerning the neural mechanisms sensitive to individual variations in trait anxiety and WM performance, which dissociate the detrimental impact of emotion distraction and the engagement of mechanisms to cope with distracting emotions.

BACKGROUND Bipolar spectrum disorders are often misdiagnosed because of the wide range of symptoms seen in patients. The consequences of delayed diagnoses or misdiagnoses can be devastating.   DESIGN A cross-sectional research design.   METHOD Two hundred patients with affective disorders from a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Taiwan were enrolled. Internal consistency reliability and two-week test-retest reliability were performed to evaluate the reliability of the C-BSDS. Expert content validity and factor analysis were used for testing construct validity. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity, the Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used as the gold standard for diagnosis.   RESULTS The internal consistency coefficient measured by intra-class correlation (ICC) was 0.81, the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.85 and the expert validity was 0.85. For construct validity, 'irritable and hyper-energetic factors' and 'depressed and lack of energy factors' were extracted by factor analysis. These two factors reflected the structure of the original scale and accounted for 33.27% of the variance. The optimal cut-off was 12, which yielded a sensitivity of 74 and a specificity of 0.97 for detecting bipolar disorder and for bipolar II disorder these were 0.79 and 0.68, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS The C-BSDS showed good reliability and validity, and the results were consistent with the English version of the BSDS.

Rituximab, a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)1-3. Among biologic therapies, rituximab is unique in that improvement is long-lasting, with significant efficacy shown at 6 months following a single course of 2 infusions in randomized clinical trials. Sustained efficacy upon retreatment has been observed in open-label extension studies. Retreatment intervals in open-label extension studies have been variable, as patients were required to flare and have active disease prior to receiving retreatment. Retreatments typically occurred 30 to 40 weeks apart, depending on the trial1-4. This resulted in worsening disease activity on average between retreatment courses. Although efficacy is long-lasting, the majority of patients require retreatment to maintain disease control. A previous study has shown that disease flare, defined by loss of European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, occurred on average at about 32 weeks5. Other analyses showed that the less that disease activity was allowed to worsen before retreatment with rituximab, the better the outcome after a second course6,7. The goal of RA treatment is remission or at least a state of low disease activity, to improve symptoms and function Journal of Rheumatology The on December 13, 2014 Published by www.jrheum.org Downloaded from and reduce longterm disability and comorbidities. It has been shown that aggressive and \u201ctight control\u201d increases the likelihood of achieving these outcomes8,9. The goal of retreatment is thus to maintain tighter and more effective disease management and control. To date, placebo-controlled retreatment of rituximab in a randomized, double-blind setting has not been studied. The objective of the Study for UNderstanding RItuximab Safety and Efficacy (SUNRISE) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1 versus 2 courses of rituximab over 48 weeks in patients with RA who are receiving methotrexate (MTX) and who have had an inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients aged 18\u201380 years old with active RA for \u2265 6 months per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised criteria10 were eligible. Patients were required to have \u2265 8 swollen joints (of 66 joints assessed) and \u2265 8 tender joints (of 68 joints assessed), and either a C-reactive protein (CRP) level \u2265 0.6 mg/dl or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) \u2265 28 mm/hour at screening. Enrolled patients were required to have a previous inadequate response to TNF inhibitors (i.e., treatment with etanercept for \u2265 3 months at doses of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg weekly, at least 4 infusions of \u2265 3 mg/kg infliximab, or 40 mg of adalimumab every other week for \u2265 3 months). Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment must have been discontinued for \u2265 4 weeks prior to Day 1, and \u2265 8 weeks for the following: leflunomide (or \u2265 14 days after standard cholestyramine washout), infliximab, and adalimumab. Use of MTX for \u2265 12 weeks, at a stable dose of 10\u201325 mg/week for \u2265 4 weeks prior to infusion, was required. Corticosteroid use was permitted, if the dose was stable at \u2264 10 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) for \u2265 4 weeks prior to infusion, and was continued at this dose throughout the study. Also, stable use of 1 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug was permitted. Key exclusion criteria were a history of a rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA, significant extraarticular involvement secondary to RA, ACR functional class IV disease, uncontrolled concomitant disease, and recurrent or active infection. Patients with concurrent use of any DMARD/biologic agent other than MTX were also excluded. All patients provided signed informed consent. Study design. SUNRISE was conducted in 143 rheumatology centers in the United States. Patients were discontinued from all DMARD except MTX and continued to receive 10\u201325 mg/week MTX at a stable dose for the duration of the study. All patients received open-label intravenous (IV) rituximab (1000 mg given 2 weeks apart) in combination with MTX as their first course, with premedication with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV before each infusion. From Week 24, patients who had a Disease Activity Score (DAS) in 28 joints based on ESR \u2265 2.6, i.e., who had not achieved DAS remission, were randomized double-blind at a ratio of 2:1 to receive either infusions of rituximab or placebo while continuing MTX. In addition to the described criteria, exclusion criteria for randomization/retreatment included active infection and uncontrolled concomitant illness. For patients who did not initially meet retreatment criteria at Week 24, randomization could occur through Week 40. Clinical endpoints. The primary endpoint was ACR20 at Week 48 relative to baseline in the rituximab retreatment group versus the placebo retreatment group11.

Previous studies could demonstrate that cancer patients benefit from massage therapy on the physical and psychological level. This pilot study investigates the effects of massage on depression, mood, perceived stress, and the Th1/Th2 ratio in breast cancer patients.MethodsThirty-four breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to a massage group (n\u2009=\u200917) and a control group (n\u2009=\u200917). Patients of the massage group received two 30-min classical massages per week for 5\u00a0weeks. At baseline, at the end of the intervention period, and 6\u00a0weeks after the end of intervention, patients of both groups completed the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and the Berlin Mood Questionnaire (BFS) and blood was withdrawn for determining cytokine concentrations and the Th1/Th2 ratio.ResultsTwenty-nine patients were included in the statistical analysis. Depression (PHQ) and anxious depression (BSF) were significantly reduced immediately after massage compared to the control group. Stress (PSQ) and elevated mood (BSF) did not show significant alterations after massage therapy. Changes of cytokine concentrations and Th1/Th2 ratio were insignificant as well, although there was a slight shift towards Th1 in the massage group over time.ConclusionsMassage therapy is an efficient treatment for reducing depression in breast cancer patients.

It is still unclear whether homocysteine-induced oxidative stress is implicated in the regulation of ET-1 expression. We examined the impact of acute homocysteinemia on endothelial function in hypertensive patients and healthy individuals, and the potential role of ET-1. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 39 hypertensive and 49 healthy individuals were randomized to receive high-dose vitamins (2 g vitamin C and 800IU vitamin E) or placebo followed by methionine loading 100 mg/kg body weight. Endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) and endothelium-independent dilation (EID) of the brachial artery were evaluated by plethysmography, at baseline and 4 h postloading (4 h PML). ET-1 was measured by ELISA, whereas total lipid hydroperoxides (per-ox) levels were measured by a commercially available photometric technique. Results Acute, methionine-induced homocysteinemia decreased EDD in all study groups (P < 0.001 for all), whereas vitamins pretreatment failed to prevent this effect, despite the vitamins-induced reduction of peroxidation in the hypertensives group (P < 0.05). On the contrary, methionine loading significantly increased plasma ET-1 levels only in hypertensives (P < 0.05), an effect which was not prevented by antioxidant vitamins (P < 0.05). EID remained unchanged after methionine loading, in all study groups (P = NS for all groups).

With increasing cancer control there is growing concern regarding the long-term effects of treatment. These effects are seen as white matter change (WMC) on brain MRI. Severity of WMC is implicated in cognitive and functional decline in many patient groups. Our objective was to identify clinical factors associated with greater accumulation of WMC following WBRT. Through retrospective review of serial MRIs obtained from 30 patients surviving greater than 1\u00a0year after WBRT, treated at a single institution between 2002 and 2007, we calculated volumetric WMC over time using segmentation software. Changes related to tumor, secondary effects, surgery or radiosurgery were excluded. Factors that influenced the rate of WMC accumulation were identified through multivariate analysis. Following WBRT, patients accumulated WMC at an average rate of 0.07% of total brain volume per month. In multivariate analyses, greater rates of accumulation were independently associated with older age (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), poor levels of glycemic control (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.048, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and hypertension diagnosis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.084, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Long-term survivors of cancer allow assessment of late effects of treatment modalities. Radiation injury appears to be related to a steady rate of white matter damage over time, as indicated by progressive accumulation of WMC. Our results suggest that rate of WMC accumulation is enhanced by parameters such as hyperglycemia and hypertension.

According to the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines, hypertension in pediatric patients is defined as systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) persistently exceeding the 95th percentile. It may manifest secondary to another disease process, such as coarctation of the aorta, endocrine disease, or renal disease, with the likelihood of there being an underlying disease inversely related to age anddirectly related to the degree ofBP elevation.Hypertension may also manifest without identifiable cause (essential hypertension). Although, as in adults, essential hypertension is more prevalent than secondary hypertension in pediatric patients, it is rarely observed in infants and young children; the prevalence of essential hypertension is significantly elevated in adolescence and often associated with excess weight and a family history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Although the long-term sequelae associatedwith hypertension (e.g. heart failure, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke) rarely manifest in children, elevated BP levels are predictive of the development of adult hypertension and are associated with the early markers of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, decreased arterial compliance, diastolic dysfunction, increased intima-media thickness, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, correctly identifying and evaluating pediatric patients with elevated BP levels may improve the accuracy of predicting hypertension in later life and avert the cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. Candesartan cilexetil (Atacand ) is the orally administered prodrug of candesartan, an angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist. The features and properties of candesartan cilexetil are presented in table I. The pharmacokinetics (area under the plasma concentrationtime curve andmaximumplasma concentration) of candesartan do not appear to be affected by age, sex, or weight, with a similar exposure observed in children aged 1 to <6 years or >6 years and adults. Therapy with candesartan cilexetil 0.05, 0.20, and 0.40mg/ kg/day for 4 weeks was effective in the treatment of hypertension in children aged 1 to <6 years, inducing significant dosedependent reductions from baseline in sitting SBP (SSBP) [primary endpoint] and sitting DBP (SDBP) in the doubleblind phase of a randomized, parallel-group, multinational, dose-ranging clinical study. The criteria for antihypertensive response (SBP and DBP values that were less than the 95th percentile) were met by 28\u201366% of patients. The beneficial antihypertensive effects of candesartan cilexetil therapy were sustained for up to 160 weeks. No significant difference from zero in the slope of the placebo-adjusted change in SSBP (primary endpoint) and SDBP was observed across the three candesartan cilexetil treatment groups (candesartan cilexetil 2, 8, or 16mg/day in patients weighing <50 kg and candesartan cilexetil 4, 16, or 32mg/day in patients weighing \u202150 kg) during the double-blind phase of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational, dose-ranging study in children and adolescents aged 6 to <17 years.

Studies conducted so far suggest inadequate compliance and persistence in weekly bisphosphonate treatment (under 43% after a year of treatment). Ibandronate, as a powerful bisphosphonate, has made it possible for the first time to treat osteoporosis with a single tablet per month.   OBJECTIVE Study of efficacy, safety and tolerance of ibandronate applied once a month in female patients with decreased bone mineral density (BMD).   METHODS The prospective study was conducted in 34 centres in Serbia covering the total of 370 women with reduced BMD with ibandronate once a month. Demographic data, risk factors for osteoporosis, mode of diagnosis establishment, previous treatment for osteoporosis and concomitant diseases were investigated. Efficacy of the treatment was evaluated by T-score value after 12 months versus the baseline values. Tolerance of the treatment, compliance and adverse effects were recorded.   RESULTS The sample included 97.5% post-menopausal women, 92.7% with osteoporosis. In 80% of the cases, the diagnosis was established by DXA measurement. In more than 90% of the sample, the level of physical activity was unsatisfactory, and 70% had an accompanying risk factor for osteoporosis in addition to menopause. After 12 months of treatment, 100% compliance was recorded in 84% of the patients and significant reduction (p < 0.0001) of the bone mineral loss, regardless of the previous aminobisphosphonate treatment.

OBJECTIVE To assess accuracy and generalizability of previously reported, internally validated, prebiopsy prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) gene-based nomograms when applied to a large, external, European cohort of men at risk of prostate cancer (PCa).   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Biopsy data, including urinary PCA3 score, were available for 621 men at risk of PCa who were participating in a European multi-institutional study.   INTERVENTION All patients underwent a \u226510-core prostate biopsy. Biopsy indication was based on suspicious digital rectal examination, persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen level (2.5-10 ng/ml) and/or suspicious histology (atypical small acinar proliferation of the prostate, >/= two cores affected by high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in first set of biopsies).   MEASUREMENTS PCA3 scores were assessed using the Progensa assay (Gen-Probe Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). According to the previously reported nomograms, different PCA3 score codings were used. The probability of a positive biopsy was calculated using previously published logistic regression coefficients. Predicted outcomes were compared to the actual biopsy results. Accuracy was calculated using the area under the curve as a measure of discrimination; calibration was explored graphically.   RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Biopsy-confirmed PCa was detected in 255 (41.1%) men. Median PCA3 score of biopsy-negative versus biopsy-positive men was 20 versus 48 in the total cohort, 17 versus 47 at initial biopsy, and 37 versus 53 at repeat biopsy (all p\u22640.002). External validation of all four previously reported PCA3-based nomograms demonstrated equally high accuracy (0.73-0.75) and excellent calibration. The main limitations of the study reside in its early detection setting, referral scenario, and participation of only tertiary-care centers.

Methods: A multicenter, randomized control clinical trial was undertaken; it comprised of 22 hospitals in China. Three hundred and four patients with hemorrhage in the basal ganglion were randomly assigned to receive the craniopuncture combined with urokinase infusion therapy (n=159) or clearance of hematoma by craniotomy with small bone flap treatment (n=145). The main indexes of evaluation were the neurological impairment degree at day 14 after treatment, activities of daily living at day 90 and the case fatality by 90 days. Results: The main results were as follows: (1) there was a significant difference in favorable outcomes (Barthel index \u226595) between the two groups (\u03c72=3\u00b795, p<0\u00b705), which showed a better prognosis in the craniopuncture group, although there was no significant difference in improving the neurological functions and activities of daily living at day 90; (2) there was a remarkable decrease in case fatality by 90 days in the cranipuncture group, with statistically significant difference between the two groups (\u03c72=5\u00b735, p=0\u00b702); (3) the re-bleeding rate in cranipuncture group was 8\u00b78%, significantly (\u03c72=9\u00b751, p=0\u00b7002) lower than 21\u00b74% in the craniotomy group.

METHODS Three hundred forty-three healthy western trekkers were recruited at altitudes of 4280 m and 4358 m and assigned to receive ibuprofen 600 mg, acetazolamide 85 mg, or placebo 3 times daily before continued ascent to 4928 m. Outcome measures included headache incidence and severity, AMS incidence and severity on the Lake Louise AMS Questionnaire (LLQ), and visual analog scale (VAS).   RESULTS Two hundred sixty-five of 343 subjects completed the trial. HAH incidence was similar when treated with acetazolamide (27.1%) or ibuprofen (27.5%; P = .95), and both agents were significantly more effective than placebo (45.3%; P = .01). AMS incidence was similar when treated with acetazolamide (18.8%) or ibuprofen (13.7%; P = .34), and both agents were significantly more effective than placebo (28.6%; P = .03).

This study was conducted to determine the impact of more intensive written information on patients' anxiety levels. The secondary aim was to determine the impact of this information on patients' satisfaction levels.   MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective randomized trial consisted of patients with a pathological diagnosis of cancer having radical radiotherapy (RT). Patients were randomized to receive the more intensive information (including written information and a telephone call from the research nurse) or not to receive the more intensive information at the time of their initial consultation with the radiation oncologist. Study questionnaires measuring anxiety (STAI form) were completed prior to their first consultation (baseline) at the time of simulation (pre-RT) and at the completion of radiotherapy. A second questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the information given (ISQ) was completed at the time of simulation prior to commencing RT.   RESULTS One hundred and ninety-four patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years and 70% of patients were female. Breast cancer (67%) was the commonest cancer. One hundred and two patients were randomized to receive the intensive information package and 92 patients received the standard consultation. There was no significant difference in mean State or Trait anxiety scores between any of the time intervals and no difference between the two information groups. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to mean satisfaction scores with the overall information given, nor with any individual question. The satisfaction scores with lifestyle information given were lower than those for any other type of information in both randomization arms.

Time spent in minutes per session at vigorous intensity (80%-100% of predicted peak heart rate) (24.9\u00a0\u00b1 20 min vs. 13.7\u00a0\u00b1 12.8 min, p\u00a0< 0.05) and average distance (km) pedaled per session (12.5\u00a0\u00b1 2.8 km vs. 10.2\u00a0\u00b1 2.2 km, p\u00a0< 0.05) also favoured the music group. However, both interventions produced significant improvements in submaximal indicators of aerobic fitness as measured by a graded cycle ergometer protocol. Also, when collapsed, the exercise modalities reduced body fat percentage and total cholesterol. The present study indicates that cycling to music was just as effective as stationary cycling while playing video games at improving fitness, body composition, and cholesterol profiles in overweight and obese teens, and resulted in increased attendance, vigorous intensity of physical activity, and distance pedaled.

Despite this, it is performed by a minority of colorectal surgeons. The aim of our study was to evaluate the short-term clinical, oncological and survival outcomes in all patients undergoing laparoscopic resection for colon cancer.MethodsFrom July 2005 to December 2008, 202 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colon cancer. Surgery was analysed on an intention to treat basis. The mean follow-up was 24.3 months.ResultsTwo hundred twenty-two patients underwent resection for colon cancer. Two hundred two underwent laparoscopic resection (91%). One hundred sixteen were male patients. Mean age was 65.9 years (range = 24\u201391). The median length of stay was 6.6 days (mean = 7.1 days). One hundred eighty-eight of 202 (93.1%) were completed laparoscopically. Fourteen (6.9%) were converted. The overall morbidity rate was 15.8%. There were three clinically apparent anastomotic leaks. The 30-day mortality was 1 (0.5%). The mean nodal yield was 13.4 (range = 8\u201337) nodes. There were no positive margins detected. Overall survival in laparoscopically treated colon cancer was 88.1%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Cancer and Leukemia Group B study CALGB 49907 was a randomly assigned trial comparing standard chemotherapy versus oral chemotherapy with capecitabine in patients age 65 years or older with early-stage breast cancer. We used microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps on participants' capecitabine bottles to record pill bottle openings. Capecitabine was given in two divided daily doses for 14 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle for six cycles. Adherence was calculated as the number of doses taken divided by doses expected, taking into account toxicity-related dosing changes. A participant was defined as adherent if 80% or more of expected doses were recorded by MEMS.   RESULTS Overall, 161 patients were enrolled. Median age was 71 years (range, 65 to 89 years); 124 patients (83%) persisted with capecitabine to completion of planned protocol therapy. Adherence was 78% across all cycles, and adherence did not vary by cycle (P = .32). Twenty-five percent of participants took fewer than 80% of expected doses and were nonadherent.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed at baseline and after 14 weeks, during which time patients with adolescent bipolar disorder were treated initially with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) followed by lamotrigine monotherapy. The primary outcome measure was a Response Inhibition Task, which involved a planned motor response, already \"on the way\" to execution, that had to be voluntarily inhibited by the subjects in the trials in which a stop signal was presented. There were 6 blocks, each with a predominant rate of either \"go\" or \"stop\" trials. The study was conducted from June 2006 through July 2009.   RESULTS All patients showed significant improvement (P < .001) in both the manic and depressive symptoms from baseline. Behavioral data showed that accuracy improved over 14 weeks in patients and healthy controls. Significant time by group interaction effects for the difference between stop versus go blocks showed greater increases of activation in prefrontal (left inferior and middle frontal gyri and medial frontal gyrus bilaterally) and temporal (left superior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus) regions and greater decreases in activation in right putamen and bilateral thalamus at follow-up in the adolescent bipolar disorder group than in healthy controls.

Methods: Japanese insulin-na\u00efve patients were randomized to receive either biphasic insulin aspart 30 twice daily or insulin aspart three times daily with or without multiple injections of NPH insulin for a treatment period lasting 6 months.  Results: Reduction of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at the end of 6 months was not different in the two treatment groups irrespective of BMI, age and duration of diabetes. However, the achievement rate of HbA1c <7.0% was significantly higher in patients with a BMI <25 kg/m2 in the multiple-injection group and tended to be higher in patients with a diabetes duration <10 years in the twice-daily injection group.  Conclusion: Twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 may be more suitable for obese patients whereas multiple injections of insulin aspart with or without NPH insulin may be preferable for those with a longer duration of diabetes.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "354f7c3b0f297d1acb8633ff3354eca741013227", "text": "BACKGROUND Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be especially vulnerable to the side effects of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), especially those that impair cognition.

Secondary prevention requires management of multiple risk factors but current management is suboptimal. Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to improve poststroke risk factor management from well-designed trials is limited. We assessed the effectiveness of a patient and general practitioner systematic follow-up intervention to improve risk factor management after stroke. Methods\u2014 We undertook a pragmatic cluster trial involving 523 consecutive incident stroke survivors identified using the population South London Stroke Register and registered with general practices in inner-city London. Practices were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention entailed systematically identifying stroke survivors' risk factors for recurrence and providing tailored evidence-based management advice to general practitioners, patients, and caregivers at 10 weeks, 5 months, and 8 months poststroke. The primary outcome was management of key modifiable risk factors for stroke at 1 year with 3 end points: treatment with antihypertensive therapy, treatment with antiplatelet therapy, and smoking cessation. Hierarchical testing was used to adjust for multiple endpoints. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as number ISRCTN10730637.

In the case of axillary FDG PET uptake, patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). If the second FDG PET scan was negative for axillary involvement, SNB was performed in order to evaluate axillary lymph node status. Only in the case of SN positivity did total ALND follow.ResultsSpecificity and positive predictive value of FDG PET for detection of axillary lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant therapy were as high as 83% (95% confidence interval: 51\u201397%) and 85% (95% confidence interval: 54\u201397%), respectively, whereas sensitivity, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy were inadequate for a correct staging (34, 32 and 48%, respectively).ConclusionThe poor sensitivity of FDG PET in detecting axillary lymph node metastases makes SNB mandatory in cases of a negative scan.

Experience with lenalidomide (3) in the management of patients with MM and renal impairment is scarce. We present the results of a retrospective study in a group of 15 patients from 11 Spanish centers with MM and severe renal impairment requiring dialysis and receiving lenalidomide-based therapy at the time of study entry. Response criteria were based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria (4). Patient features at the time of inclusion are summarized in Table 1. Two patients had renal impairment requiring dialysis before myeloma diagnosis. The remaining thirteen patients developed renal failure at diagnosis or during the evolution of the disease, and it was because of MM (six patients), drug-related (two patients), secondary to underlying diabetes (two patients), and secondary to a tumoral lysis syndrome because of bortezomib (one patient). Finally, no data were available in the remaining two patients. Thirteen (86%) patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 15 mg \u2044d, three times a week after dialysis and in combination with dexamethasone (Table 1). Patients received a median of eight cycles (range, 1\u201328) of lenalidomide treatment. Hematological toxicity was the toxicity more frequently seen and required dose reduction in eight (53%) patients, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor prophylaxis in seven (47%). Ten patients developed neutropenia (6 grade 3\u20134), and seven (47%) patients presented thrombocytopenia (1 grade 3). Finally, two (13%) patients presented grade 2 anemia. Six (40%) patients developed seven infectious episodes during the study period, five of them within the first four cycles of therapy. There were four (57%) bacteremias, two (29%) pneumonias, and one (14%) central venous line infection (Table 2). Other non-hematological complications are shown in Table 2. There were no thromboembolic complications. Overall response rate was 60% (nine patients), with four (29%) achieving complete response (CR), one (7%) patient very good partial response, and four (29%) patients partial response. Median time to best response was 4 months. With a median follow-up of 13 months (range 1\u201328), median progression-free and overall survival was 15 and 20 months, respectively. Among responding patients, median duration of response has not been reached. Seven (47%) patients have died because of disease progression (five patients) and of infectious complications (two patients) and eight (53%) are still alive, seven with continuous lenalidomde treatment and one off therapy because of disease progression. Renal function remained stable in all but one patient who was spared from dialysis after achieving partial response 3 months after starting treatment. Currently, there is no standard treatment for patients with MM and renal failure requiring dialysis. Results with new agents such as thalidomide and bortezomib are disparate. With thalidomide, experience is scarce and has been associated with a high incidence of hyperkaliemia in patients with serum creatinine >3 mg \u2044dL (5, 6). Better results have been reported with bortezomib-based regimens, with a response rate of 75% with 30% of CR + near CR and with a toxicity profile similar to that observed in patients with normal renal function (7). Lenalidomide has been shown to undergo substantial elimination via the kidneys, and recently, encouraging results have been reported in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (3). However, no data in patients with MM and advanced renal failure requiring dialysis are available. Our report is the first one including this high-risk subgroup of patients with MM and show a response rate of 65% with 29% of CR like that seen in patients with normal renal function (1, 2). Importantly, progression-free and overall survival was also similar to that reported in patients without significant renal failure (1, 2). Finally, among responding patients, median duration of response has not been reached, pointing that durability of response is also comparable to those of patients with MM with normal renal function in the relapsed setting (1, 2).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality.

These devices have been designed for the treatment of complex shaped and large size aneurysms. So far published safety and efficacy data on this approach is sparse. Material and Methods Over 8 months, standardized clinical and angiographic data were collected on 70 patients treated with a flow diverter device (SILK flow diverter (SFD)) in 18 centres worldwide. Treatment and early follow up details were audited centrally. SFDs were deployed alone in 57 (81%) or with endosaccular coils in 10 (14%) aneurysms, which included: 44 (63%) saccular, 26 (37%) fusiform shapes and 18 (26%) small, 37 (53%) large, 15 (21%) giant sizes. Treatment outcome data up to 30 days were reported for all patients, with clinical (50 patients) and imaging (49 patients) follow up (median 119 days) data available. Results Difficulties in SFD deployment were reported in 15 (21%) and parent artery thrombosis in 8 (11%) procedures.

BACKGROUND Despite the substantial evidence indicating the beneficial effects of relaxation therapy on the health-related quality of life of various cardiac populations, the value of this intervention in patients with chronic heart failure remains uncertain. Even less is known about its therapeutic effects in Chinese culture.   METHOD A total of 121 Chinese patients with chronic heart failure and over 60 years of age were recruited in 2002-2003 and randomly allocated to a relaxation training programme (n = 59) or an attention-control intervention (n = 62). The training included two relaxation training sessions, one skill revision workshop, twice daily relaxation self-practice and biweekly telephone follow-up. The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire was completed at hospital discharge and at the 8th and 14th weeks after discharge.   RESULTS Repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that those who attended the relaxation training programme reported statistically significantly greater improvement in psychological (P = 0.007, eta(2) = 0.043) and social (P = 0.016, eta(2) = 0.035) health-related quality of life than those who received the attention-control intervention over the evaluative period. Comparing outcomes at timepoints showed that the statistically significant group differences in the improvement of psychological and social health-related quality of life occurred mainly during the first evaluative endpoints.

Its use for all subjects with sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of daytime symptoms, is unclear.   OBJECTIVES This multicenter controlled trial assesses the effects of 1 year of CPAP treatment on blood pressure (BP) in nonsymptomatic, hypertensive patients with OSA.   METHODS We evaluated 359 patients with OSA. Inclusion criteria consisted of an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 19 hour(-1), an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score less than 11, and one of the following: under antihypertensive treatment or systolic blood pressure greater than 140 or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to CPAP (n = 178) or to conservative treatment (n = 181). BP was evaluated at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mean (SD) values were as follows: age, 56 +/- 10 years; body mass index (BMI), 32 +/- 5 kg x m(-2); AHI, 45 +/- 20 hour(-1); and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, 7 +/- 3. After adjusting for follow-up time, baseline blood pressure values, AHI, time with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, and BMI, together with the change in BMI at follow-up, CPAP treatment decreased systolic blood pressure by 1.89 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: -3.90, 0.11 mm Hg; P = 0.0654), and diastolic blood pressure by 2.19 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: -3.46, -0.93 mm Hg; P = 0.0008). The most significant reduction in BP was in patients who used CPAP for more than 5.6 hours per night. CPAP compliance was related to AHI and the decrease in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score.   CONCLUSIONS In nonsleepy hypertensive patients with OSA, CPAP treatment for 1 year is associated with a small decrease in BP.

However, acupressure's underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One theory is that acupoint stimulation modulates autonomic nervous system activity. Previous studies have suggested that acupressure may positively affect heart rate and blood pressure. The current study investigated the effects of a type of acupressure, Jin Shin, on cardiovascular function in stroke survivors, a population that could especially benefit from a treatment promoting cardiovascular health. The study tested the hypothesis that active acupressure treatments would reduce heart rate and blood pressure (i.e., induce a greater relaxation response) above and beyond that seen during placebo acupressure treatments.   METHODS A randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind crossover design was utilised, in which 16 participants received 8 weeks of either active or placebo acupressure followed by washout and crossover into the opposite treatment condition. Heart rate and blood pressure measurements were taken throughout treatments.   RESULTS Active acupressure treatments were associated with a significantly greater (p=.043, eta(2)=.30) and faster (p=.002, eta(2)=.76) reduction in heart rate compared to that seen during placebo treatments.

After 12 months, the median scores for sphincter management of the bladder for both BSPS and non-BSPS patients were 15. Both 25 and 75% quartile median scores were 15 for BSPS patients and 12 and 15 for non-BSPS patients (P<0.02). Except for the difference in bladder function, no significant differences were identified in other SCIM II subitems and ASIA motor or sensory scores between BSPS and non-BSPS patients when stratified for injury severity by excluding AIS B patients.Conclusion:Compared with incomplete tetraplegic patients, patients with cervical BSPS have a similar neurological and functional recovery when matched for the AIS.", "1_year_count": 3, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "0098f1a4bc763911635e2f77517b142577cdf633", "text": "Default mode network (DMN) is characterized by a deactivation of several cortical areas (including medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) during goal-directed experimental tasks. Few findings are reported on DMN and the involvement of dopaminergic medication on this network in Parkinson's disease (PD). To evaluate the effect of levodopa on DMN deactivation, we conducted a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled experiment consisting of two fMRI assessments in fourteen non-demented, non-depressed PD patients compared to thirteen healthy volunteers. They received either acute doses of levodopa or placebo in two fMRI sessions. Brain deactivation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition task. While the control subjects showed a classical brain deactivation pattern during the emotional task, the PD patients taking placebo only deactivated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Patients failed to deactivate the posterior midline and lateral parts of DMN network. After levodopa administration, this network was restored conjointly with the improvement of motor dysfunction in PD patients. The levodopa effect on DMN is probably the consequence of a beneficial dopamine (DA) medication effect which leads to a fine tuning of the dopamine level in the motor part of striatum, resulting to a global improvement of physical state of PD patients and consequently an increased attentional resource to external stimuli. The absence of medial prefrontal deactivation impairment may suggest a preserved mesocortical DA system in these patients.", "1_year_count": 4, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "8ddb5a88fec0b3844ba72ee747a089be5662feef", "text": "Background Data of the German Competence Network for Community-Acquired Pneumonia showed a gap between the recommendations of the national guideline for management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the routine care. We developed and evaluated an implementation strategy to improve the quality of care of patients with CAP. Method A prospective, randomised, controlled trail was conducted within CAPNETZ. In four local clinical centres (LCC), the guideline was implemented by different strategies. The other four LCC served as control group. Indicators for guideline adherence comprised initial site of treatment, initial antibiotic treatment and duration of antibiotic treatment. As patient-related factors, we assessed the effect of guideline implementation on 30-day mortality and length of hospital stay. Results Active guideline implementation yielded an increased proportion of guideline adherence to the length of antibiotic treatment in outpatients (+9.2%), the recommended antibiotic treatment (+5.6%) and duration of antibiotic treatment in inpatients (+5.0%) compared with baseline. In contrast, the proportion of patients in the control group, treated according to the guideline, decreased in the same period by 7.9%, 2.9% and 4.7%, respectively. None of these results was statistically significant. Decrease of CAP-related mortality was higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (2.9% vs 0.5%, ns).

DESIGN A randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis.   PARTICIPANTS Sixty people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between 8% and 10% in the past month.   INTERVENTION One group undertook progressive resistance exercise and the other group undertook aerobic exercise. Both groups completed 18 sessions over 8 weeks. In each session, the progressive resistance exercise group did nine resistive exercises while the aerobic exercise group did 50 minutes of aerobic exercise.   OUTCOME MEASURES HbA1c, blood glucose, lipid profile (total, high- and low-density cholesterol and triglycerides), weight, body mass index, body fat, waist circumference, waist:hip ratio, blood pressure, and peak oxygen consumption.   RESULTS Forty-nine (82%) participants completed the intervention. HbA1c reduced by a similar amount in both groups (MD 0.1%, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5). However, significant between-group differences occurred in change in waist circumference in favour of progressive resistance exercise (MD -1.8 cm, 95% CI -0.5 to -3.1), and in change in peak oxygen consumption in favour of aerobic exercise (MD 5.2 ml/kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 10.4).

The Zwolle Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Index is an externally validated risk score that has been used to identify low-risk STEMI patients who have undergone primary PCI and can safely be discharged from hospital within 72 hours. Previous studies have shown that many low-risk patients remain in hospital significantly longer.   METHODS We randomly assigned 54 low-risk STEMI patients treated with primary or rescue PCI to 1 of 2 groups. Patients in the intervention group (n = 27) were actively targeted for early hospital discharge (48-72 hours) and received outpatient follow-up with an advanced practice nurse (APN). In the control group (n = 27), discharge planning and follow-up were left to the treating physician, and there was no added nursing intervention. The 2 primary outcomes of this pilot study were to demonstrate feasibility and safety. Secondary outcomes included compliance with medications, smoking cessation, attendance at cardiac rehabilitation, and quality of life, measured in both groups at 6 weeks time.   RESULTS In the intervention group, 74% of patients were discharged within 72 hours, 100% had follow-up with the APN within 3 days (74% in person, 26% by phone), and 100% had >/= 3 APN follow-ups in total, meeting our prespecified criteria for feasibility. The median length of stay was 55 hours in both groups. There were no deaths in either group, and there was no difference in rehospitalization between patients in the intervention and control groups (8% vs 4%, P = .56). There was no difference in rates of medication compliance, smoking cessation, attendance at cardiac rehabilitation, or quality of life between the 2 groups, although our small pilot study was not powered to detect a difference in these outcomes.   CONCLUSION In low-risk STEMI patients treated with primary or rescue PCI, a strategy of early hospital discharge facilitated by close nursing follow-up is feasible. Although our study did not identify differences in compliance or quality of life between the 2 groups, it did provide a functional study design for a larger trial powered to detect these important clinical end points.", "1_year_count": 3, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "38d291bc0b5210a800365e108de3a19457e35712", "text": "UNLABELLED The prevalence of diabetes in Mexico among those 20-64 years of age has increased from 7.2% in 1993 to 10.7% in 2000. National population-based surveys in Mexico demonstrated that 50% of the total population with diabetes had blood glucose levels of 200mg/dl or higher. Thus, diabetes care has become one of the most important public health challenges in this country. The aim of the study was to improve the quality of diabetes care in primary health care centers using the chronic care model and the breakthrough series (BTS) collaborative methodology.   METHODS Ten public health centers in the cities of Xalapa and Veracruz were randomly selected to participate in the project. Five of the health centers were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (intervention group) and the other five followed usual care (usual care group). The intervention was evaluated by A1c test before and after the intervention in both groups of patients. Patients were followed for 18 months from November 2002 to May 2004. Results were adjusted for the clustering of patients within practices and baseline measure.   RESULTS The proportion of people with good glycemic control (A1c<7%) among those in the intervention group increased from 28% before the intervention to 39% after the intervention. The proportion of patients achieving three or more quality improvement goals increased from 16.6% to 69.7% (p<0.001) among the intervention group while the usual care group experienced a non-significant decrease from 12.4% to 5.9% (p=0.118). The focus on the primary care team and the participation of people with diabetes were strategic elements incorporated into the methodology, expected to ensure sustainability of continued improvement of health outcomes.

Randomized trials provide a reference standard for comparing outcomes after BMS or DES, but the rates of repeat revascularization procedures in clinical trials do not necessarily represent the rates in routine practice.   METHODS Baseline and 1-year follow-up angiographic data from a cardiac catheterization laboratory data registry with 31 participating hospitals were analyzed.   RESULTS In 17 hospitals 14,459 eligible patients had a BMS implanted between 1998 and 2003, and in 20 hospitals 9,575 eligible patients had a DES implanted in 2005. DES patients had more multivessel disease and diabetes than BMS patients, but fewer DES patients had all diseased vessels stented. Over the subsequent year, there were significantly fewer repeat procedures in the initially stented region after DES than BMS (4.7% vs. 8.1%), but significantly more procedures in previously unstented remote segments (7.8% vs. 4.3%). Consequently, the overall rate of additional percutaneous coronary intervention admissions was not reduced by DES (12.5% vs. 12.3%; p > 0.7).   CONCLUSIONS In this sample of routine clinical practice DES reduced repeat intervention of the stented segment to a lesser extent than has been reported in randomized trials. For our cohort, the reduction in restenosis was offset by increased use of additional interventional procedures to treat remote segments, predominantly within the first 2 months after initial stenting.", "1_year_count": 0, "label": 0}, {"paper_id": "895d47e35293975d16280f96b7b114f481a5ca9a", "text": "PurposeThis study evaluated differences in stress response and immunological function following laparoscopic and conventional total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer.MethodsPatients with non-metastasized rectal cancer were prospectively randomized to open (n\u2009=\u200918) or laparoscopic (n\u2009=\u200922) TME. Blood samples were taken preoperatively (baseline), 2, 24, and 72\u00a0h following surgery. Systemic white blood cell and monocyte count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), HLA-DR expression on monocytes, growth hormone, prolactin, and cortisol were measured.ResultsForty patients with a median age of 66\u00a0years (interquartile range, 60\u201374\u00a0years) were included. Eighteen patients (45%) were randomized to open surgery and 22 patients (55%) to laparoscopic surgery. Patient demographics in terms of gender, age, BMI, ASA classification, localization of the tumor, and type of neoadjuvant therapy were comparable for both groups. Laparoscopic surgery resulted in a significantly better short-term preservation of postoperative immune function. HLA-DR expression on monocytes was significantly higher (64% vs 50%, P\u2009=\u20090.014) and IL-6 level increase was significantly lower (4.6 vs 10.8, P\u2009=\u20090.003) 2\u00a0h after laparoscopic surgery. No differences between the open and laparoscopic technique were observed in postoperative white blood cell count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, IL-8, growth hormone, prolactin, and cortisol levels.ConclusionShort-term postoperative immune and inflammatory functions tended to be better after laparoscopic rectal surgery. However, the differences were not consistent at all time intervals, making a definitive conclusion difficult.
